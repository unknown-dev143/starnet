SpaceStation is a local-first desktop harness where you create AI agents, organize them into a
pixel-art space station, and watch them perform real work with real models and tools. The
station is not decoration — it is a projection of live runtime state, and the product contract
is literal: **A room is a capability-scoped team**, **a hallway is** an authorized handoff
lane, and **a placed object is a real capability grant**.
The layout you draw *is* the workflow the agents run.

Start with one agent, then place bays or summon specialists to run **more, concurrently** —
each a **genuinely distinct, bounded agent run** with its own workspace and permissions.
The harness performs **real model calls, real tools, real cost** rather than animating a
simulation.

## Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **A crew, not a chatbot** | Create agents with distinct classes, personas, and loadouts. Run several at once — each gets its own workspace, transcript, memory, and bounded permissions. |
| **Bring your own models** | Paste an OpenRouter key, or sign in with supported provider accounts (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) — keys live in the OS keychain, never in the frontend. |
| **Message it from anywhere** | Wire agents to Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, or Matrix and talk to your station away from the desk. |
| **Night Shift** | Leave the station running and agents keep working inside an explicit, adjustable leash — every away-action is logged and reviewable. |
| **Recipes, skills, schedules** | Launch proven multi-step recipes, grant reusable skills, and put work on cron schedules with visible output. |
| **Asks before it guesses** | Task Briefs turn ambiguity into one concrete question with options — over any connected channel — instead of a silent wrong guess. |
| **Finished work has a front door** | Deliverables land in the OUTBOX as real files you open, not chat scrollback you archaeology. |
| **MCP connectors** | Attach Model Context Protocol servers and paste-a-key/OAuth connectors to extend what agents can touch. |
| **Voice** | Push-to-talk dictation in, one consistent station voice out. |
| **Real ledgers** | Spend, budgets, and run history persist on disk and are shown as-is. |

## What is real

- Model calls stream through the local Node sidecar.
- Tools operate through explicit capability and consent checks.
- Agent memory, transcripts, spend records, tasks, and schedules persist on disk.
- Multiple agents run concurrently with separate workspaces and bounded permissions.
- The visual station projects the same runtime state the harness can prove.

SpaceStation does not simulate revenue, completed work, model activity, or spend. Its core product
law is that **the interface must never assert state the harness cannot prove.**

## Download

Desktop builds are published on the
[releases page](https://github.com/androoAGI/starnet-releases/releases/latest).

| Platform | Asset |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows** (10/11, 64-bit) | `SpaceStation_<version>_x64-setup.exe` |
| **macOS — Apple Silicon** (M1–M4) | `SpaceStation_<version>_aarch64.dmg` |
| **macOS — Intel** | `SpaceStation_<version>_x64.dmg` |

> **Apple Silicon note:** use the native `aarch64` DMG. Avoid the `x64` DMG on Apple Silicon:
> it runs under Rosetta 2 rather than using the native architecture.

The public release train supports Windows and macOS. It refuses to stage a release unless the
Windows installer passes Authenticode and timestamp verification, both Mac builds pass
Developer ID checks and Apple notarization, and every updater artifact has a valid updater
signature. Those are pipeline requirements, not proof that a particular downloaded or installed
copy was tested on your machine; [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) explains what to verify and when to stop.
Linux packages are internal build artifacts only and are not a supported public release target.

> **Early release:** Windows is the most-tested desktop target. macOS has less real-world
> coverage. Broken? Tell us:
> **androo.agi@gmail.com**.

## Run from source

Requirements: Node.js 18+ (Node.js 22 matches CI), Git. Rust and the
[Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) only for the desktop shell.

The sidecar uses Node core modules only, so it runs without installing anything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/androoAGI/starnet.git
cd starnet
node sidecar/index.js
```

Open <http://localhost:8787>, then connect a provider —
**bring your own OpenRouter API key (BYOK)** or use a supported OAuth sign-in. Provider requests leave your machine when you run an agent;
station state, transcripts, memory, and ledgers stay in the local SpaceStation workspace unless you
explicitly use a network tool or connector. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full data map.

For desktop development:

```bash
npm ci
npm run desktop:dev     # dev shell
npm run desktop:build   # build installers locally
```

## Coming from OpenClaw or Hermes?

SpaceStation can import an existing agent: point it at your on-disk OpenClaw or Hermes home and it
mints a SpaceStation agent from the persona, instructions, memory, and model it finds. API keys
never transfer — you re-enter those in the KEYS tab.

## Architecture

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | Vanilla JavaScript station world and desktop UI. |
| `sidecar/` | Local Node agent runtime: providers, tools, persistence, budgets, consent. |
| `shared/` | Additive cross-boundary event and schema contracts. |
| `src-tauri/` | Rust/Tauri desktop shell and bundled runtime. |
| `test/` | Unit, contract, integration, and release gates. |
| `qa/` | Live QA receipts, journeys, findings ledger, and release-readiness authority. |

The frontend consumes real sidecar events over localhost HTTP/NDJSON and SSE. Secrets belong
to the local authority:
**Secrets are held by the sidecar / OS keychain, never in the frontend**.

Start with [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) for the living documentation. Older planning
documents remain in the repository as design history and are labeled accordingly.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:fast          # required merge gate
npm run test:http          # live sidecar HTTP/E2E suite
npm test                   # validation + world + fast + HTTP suites
npm run security:secrets   # full-history secret scan; requires Gitleaks in PATH
```

The release aggregate is `npm run qa:ready`. It is candidate-bound: any new commit invalidates
the prior READY receipt until the affected live gates are rerun.
