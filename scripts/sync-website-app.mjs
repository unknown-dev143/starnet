 * sync-website-app.mjs — mirror frontend/ into website/app/ (`npm run sync:website`)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. website/app is the live demo embedded on starnetos.com, and both
 * website/app/demo-boot.js and website/live-preview.js describe it as "a verbatim copy of the app
 * frontend". It was not one. On 2026-07-24 the copy had drifted to 59 differing files and 394 files
 * missing outright — a months-old snapshot still advertising retired copy ("IMPORT AGENT" for a
 * button the app renamed to "RESTORE BACKUP", a provider picker with no grok/kimi). A marketing
 * surface that misrepresents the shipped product is a truthfulness bug, not a housekeeping chore,
 * and hand-patching whichever files a lane happened to touch is how it drifted in the first place.
 *
 * So the copy is now GENERATED, never edited, and test/website-app-sync.test.js runs `--check` in
 * the fast gate: any lane that changes frontend/ and forgets to re-sync fails immediately.
 *
 * THE EMBED IS NOT A PURE COPY. Three differences are deliberate and are re-applied here every run,
 * so they can never be lost to a sync and never rot into "mystery local edits":
 *   1. website-only files (demo.css, demo-boot.js) are preserved and never sourced from frontend/;
 *   2. the secondary Google Fonts <link> is stripped — the public site promises ZERO third-party
 *      requests, and VT323 already ships locally as a woff2, so the embed loses nothing;
 *   3. demo.css + demo-boot.js are injected immediately BEFORE the first app script, because
 *      demo-boot seeds the captured save and must run ahead of any store read.
 * Every anchor below is asserted. If the markup moves, this fails loudly rather than silently
 * emitting an embed that phones out to Google or boots with no demo save.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/sync-website-app.mjs           # write the mirror
 *   node scripts/sync-website-app.mjs --check   # verify only; exit 1 (and list drift) if stale
