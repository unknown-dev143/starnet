/*
 * go-live-credits.mjs — open SpaceStation Credits to members, in one reviewable step.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Turning the paid tier on used to be a hand-run checklist spread across a sidecar
 * constant, two flags in one browser file, a list inside another script, and a topnav link that had
 * been DELETED BY HAND from thirteen pages. That checklist has already been half-done once: the docs
 * pages were fixed and the legal pages were missed on the same pass, because when a mechanism is
 * per-page-family you have to enumerate every family and nothing was enumerating them.
 *
 * Half-done is the worst outcome available here. Buy buttons live against a page that is not
 * published do not 404 — Cloudflare's catch-all answers 200 with the homepage — so the site looks
 * entirely healthy while every plan link lands on a page with no prices on it.
 *
 * So: one command, all of it or none of it, and it REFUSES unless the billing service is actually
 * answering at the URL the app itself will use. The most expensive version of this mistake is
 * advertising an account nobody can create.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/go-live-credits.mjs --check   # probe the service, list every edit, write nothing
 *   node scripts/go-live-credits.mjs --apply   # make the edits (probe must pass)
 *   node scripts/go-live-credits.mjs --apply --force   # proceed on a DEGRADED (503) service
 *   node scripts/go-live-credits.mjs --check --no-probe   # skip the network call (the gate uses this)
 *
 * It does NOT cut a release, run the gate, or deploy the site — those stay deliberate acts. It
 * prints them, in order, when it finishes. Full context: starnet-cloud/LAUNCH.md
