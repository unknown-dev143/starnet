/* scripts/qa/soak.mjs — the SCRIPTED, HERMETIC, UNATTENDED soak (reliability item 4).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: until now "soak" meant a human left the packaged app running on the dev desktop for
 * 15–48h and eyeballed it. It blocked the desktop, produced no machine-readable verdict, and its one
 * failure (the first v0.10.0 soak) cost ~15h before anyone could say what broke. This runner boots a
 * hermetic SOURCE sidecar (scratch workspace + scratch app-data profile, free port, MOCK provider — zero
 * provider spend), drives a repeating workload for `--minutes N`, samples the process every tick, and
 * writes a receipt with an explicit PASS/FAIL per rule. A 6-minute smoke and a 12-hour soak are the
 * same harness with a different `--minutes`.
 *
 * WORKLOAD (per tick, see runSoak):
 *   · /api/health latency probe (3 GETs; median + max)     · /api/diagnostics read (swallowed tally, error ring)
 *   · /api/state/snapshot read                             · OS-level RSS sample of the sidecar pid
 *   · every `--run-every` ticks: a real /api/run conversation (deterministic mock answer)
 *   · every `--tool-every` ticks: a real /api/run that the mock steers into shell_exec (a real child process)
 *   · a routine "every 1 minute" armed at start; the cron driver fires it on its own (fires are counted)
 *   · every `--restart-every` minutes: stop → boot on the SAME workspace → every persisted entity must come back
 *
 * VERDICT RULES (evaluate): see RULES below — each rule states its threshold and the reason for it in the
 * receipt. An unobtainable metric is `null` with a reason, never 0.
 *
 * HOUSE PATTERN (matches scripts/qa/packaged-lifecycle.mjs): the CORE (arg parsing, statistics, evaluate,
 * receipt) is pure and tests headlessly (test/soak.test.js); the orchestrator takes injected `drivers`;
 * the INVOKED_DIRECTLY block is the one place the real sidecar, fs, and OS process tools live.
 *
 * NO NEW DEPS: node built-ins only. Reuses test/helpers/sidecar-fixture.js for the hermetic boot contract.
 *
 * NOT A REPLACEMENT for the attended packaged-desktop soak (docs/RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md): this is the source
 * sidecar under a mock provider — it cannot see the Tauri shell, WebView2, the installer, or real provider
 * behavior. It is the mandatory machine verdict that runs BEFORE the human spends desktop hours.

    minCount: 3,
    why: 'with a mock provider the steady-state fail-open count should be ~0; a permanently broken 60s maintenance loop shows as ≥1/min, so a sustained ≥0.2/min over the LAST THIRD (and at least 3 events, so a single blip cannot fail a short soak) is unbounded growth.

Epochs under 5 points are not judged (null, with reason)',

    maxP95Ms: 500,
    why: 'loopback health on a healthy loop answers in single-digit ms; a p95 over 500 ms across the LAST HALF means the event loop is stalling (blocked timers, sync I/O, GC thrash) — the class of degradation a human soak catches only as "it feels sluggish"',

  restart: {
    title: 'restart cycles keep every persisted entity',
    why: 'agents, routines, run history, and conversation turns a user expects to survive must round-trip a stop/boot on the same workspace; any id present before and missing after is data loss (the top recurring bug class)',
  },
  process: {
    title: 'sidecar never died and never orphaned a child',
    why: 'an unplanned exit is a crash; a child process STILL alive 3s after the sidecar stopped is the close-zombie class (0.10.5/0.10.6). A child seen at the instant of the stop but gone within the grace is recorded as transient (a measurement, not a failure)',
  },
  accounting: {
    title: 'every due occurrence of every routine is accounted for exactly once',
    why: 'the power-user claim is "30–50 routines a day fire each one". For EVERY seeded routine, every occurrence its schedule owes inside the soak window (enumerated with sidecar/cron.js nextFireAt from the armed nextRunAt — the scheduler\'s own math, never a re-implementation) must end as exactly ONE of: fired (cron.fire with that scheduledFor), skipped already-running (the previous run still held the lease), caught-up (misfire=skip past the grace), collapsed (a missed occurrence folded into the ONE catch-up by the misfire policy — visible only as the store\'s nextRunAt jumping more than one period), disabled (paused routine reported once per due window), or unfireable (a corrupt schedule marked once). At-capacity deferrals are transient (the occurrence stays due and must still reach a terminal). A fire whose scheduledFor is not an owed occurrence, two fires for one occurrence (a double-fire, the restart class), an owed occurrence with no terminal (lost), or a nextRunAt advance the schedule math does not predict is a FAIL. Judged only when the cron event log is readable; a soak in which a fireable routine is owed nothing is inconclusive and FAILS (the window measured no scheduling)',
  },
  tick: {
    title: 'scheduler tick latency with N routines (whole-store verified write per advance)',
    maxP95Ms: 300,
    why: 'the cron tick runs SYNCHRONOUSLY under the process lock: planTick over every job, then saveCronJobs — a full-envelope fsync write + read-back verification of ALL routines — for each advance, and again in markRun for each result. That cost is O(routines) per tick and blocks the event loop while it runs. p95 of (lastSuccessAt − lastTickAt) sampled from GET /api/cron over the LAST HALF must stay under 300 ms at the scale the product claims (50 routines); above that the tick is visibly stalling every run and chat in the station. The first tick after a boot (the post-outage catch-up burst: every missed routine fires at once) is reported as catchUpMs and excluded from p95 — it is a one-time cost, not the steady one. A breach here is a finding against the store write model (index.js saveCronJobs), not a tuning knob',
