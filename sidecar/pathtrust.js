/* sidecar/pathtrust.js — CONVERSATIONAL PATH TRUST (NS-5 Project Lens core).

   The fs.* tools are jailed to <workspaces>/<agentId>/ (fs.js resolveInside). This module is the ONE
   sanctioned way an fs tool call may reach a path OUTSIDE that jail: it resolves the referenced absolute
   path against a per-station set of BLESSED PROJECT ROOTS and, when the path is not yet under any blessed
   root, mediates a SINGLE consent decision ("work in <root>? always / once / no"). "always" records a
   standing PATH grant (dangerKey `path:<normalized-real-root>`) that the sidecar persists fail-closed and
   the existing /api/permissions surface lists + revokes. Reads flow once a root is blessed; writes stay
   consent-gated by the normal broker scope rules (this module only clears the path boundary, never the
   write-scope boundary).

   HARDLINES that no bless can cross (generalized from fs.js's jail + index.js hardlineFloor):
     • .env / .git internals anywhere in the path            (secret + repo-plumbing floor)
     • NUL bytes, UNC / network paths (\\server\share, //h)  (illegal / off-host)
     • symlink escape: the REAL (realpath-resolved) target must stay inside the blessed root's REAL path,
       re-proven on every access — a symlink planted under a blessed root cannot walk back out.

   THE UNATTENDED RULE (enforced here, not optional): only an INTERACTIVE run with a live prompt() may
   bless a NEW root. An autonomous run (surface !== 'interactive', or no prompt wired) that references an
   un-blessed outside path is a HARD DENY with NO prompt — silence is never consent, and a headless/cron
   run can never widen its own reach.

   makePathTrust({ fsp, pathMod, roots, bless, touch, isGitRepoOf, workspaceRoot, homeDir, now, maxWalk }) -> { guard, detectRoot, normalizeRoot }
     fsp        : node:fs/promises (injected) — realpath / stat only, never writes.
     pathMod    : node:path (injected).
     roots      : () => [normalizedRealRoot...]  — the LIVE blessed set (index.js derives it from the
                  `path:*` grants, so a revoke takes effect on the very next call with no restart).
     bless      : async (rootReal, { isGitRepo, now }) => bool  — persist the standing grant + upsert the
                  known-projects store (persist-before-commit in index.js); false ⇒ deny (never committed).
     touch      : (rootReal, absPath) => void  — bump lastTouchedAt on I/O under a known root (best-effort).
     isGitRepoOf: async (rootReal) => bool  — light metadata for the store (has a .git entry).
     workspaceRoot: absolute parent of the private per-agent workspaces; standing grants and Full Access do
                  not override ownership beneath this root.
     homeDir    : the user's home directory, or '' to leave the ceiling off. The ancestor walk that PROPOSES a
                  project root stops here — see detectRoot below. Injected rather than read from `os` so this
                  stays a pure core (no env, no platform globals).
     now        : injected clock.
     maxWalk    : ancestor-walk cap for git-root detection (default 40).

   guard(absPath, { scope, surface, prompt, agentId }) -> { base, abs }   // throws on any deny
     scope   : 'read' | 'write' (write only reaches here AFTER the broker's own scope consent).
     surface : 'interactive' | 'autonomous'.
     prompt  : async (proposedRoot, { path, scope }) => 'always'|'once'|'full'|'deny'|...  (null ⇒ autonomous).

   Pure decision core over injected node deps (matches fs.js / permgrants.js). No env, no wall-clock. */
