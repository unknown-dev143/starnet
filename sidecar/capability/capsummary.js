/* sidecar/capability/capsummary.js -- summarizeCapabilities: a SHORT, truthful "what you can and
   can't do right now" note appended to the agent's system prompt, derived from the SAME resolved
   grant set the tool gate enforces (resolveTools + enforceRunAuthority). Purpose: stop the agent
   VERBALLY over-promising capabilities it lacks, while also preventing the opposite failure: hiding
   real built-ins the run host actually granted.

   BOTH surfaces get a note, for different reasons:
   - INTERACTIVE: the floor is real, so a missing power is actionable -- name the object to place.
   - AUTONOMOUS/headless (cron, night shift, delegated workers, chat channels): there is no placement
     UI and no Commander watching, and enforceRunAuthority additionally strips shell/verify, live MCP
     connector tools, and Spotify on this surface REGARDLESS of what is placed. Sending no note at all
     left those runs believing they had powers the gate had already removed -- the agent then promised
     work it could not do and blamed the failure on the user's credentials. So the autonomous note
     states the same ground truth minus the (meaningless) placement advice, and tells the agent to
     report the blocker instead of pretending.

   A capId is NOT sufficient evidence of its headline power: a capId can outlive its own flagship tool
   (an autonomous run keeps workbench's background-shell and browser-test tools while shell.exec and
   verify.run are stripped). So when the caller supplies the resolved tool list -- production always
   does -- presence is confirmed against the capability's PROBE tool, not merely its capId. */
