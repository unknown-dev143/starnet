/* sidecar/capability/office.js — composeOffice: the room objects an agent's run resolves against when NO explicit
   station is routed (the non-bay path). THE MOAT (FLOOR-REAL) lives here: on the INTERACTIVE (browser COMMS)
   surface the floor is REAL — the office starts COMPUTE-ONLY (compute is the single freebie, so an agent can ALWAYS
   think and a brand-new agent works out of the box — never a dead wall) and the agent's REAL placed caps off the
   floor (extraObjects: dish→web · cabinet→files · workbench→terminal · …) are appended, so it grants exactly what
   the Commander placed and nothing it didn't. AUTONOMOUS/headless surfaces (cron, Telegram, delegated workers) have
   no in-the-moment floor UI, so they keep the full default office — placing-grants-reach is taught where the
   beginner is (the browser); silently stripping a scheduled/delegated run's web+files would regress shipped work.

   composeOffice({ surface, lead, connectorIds, extraObjects }) -> [ { instanceId, objectType, connectorId? }, … ]
   Pure: same inputs -> same array. Fed straight into resolveTools as one room's objects. */
