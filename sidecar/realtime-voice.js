   authorizes this endpoint directly — its access token carries `aud: https://api.openai.com/v1`, and a call
   with a stub offer comes back `invalid_offer` ("Offer did not have an audio media section"), i.e. it passed
   AUTH and session validation and failed only on the dummy SDP. The earlier wiring resolved an OpenAI API
   KEY, which a subscription user simply does not have, so this reported itself unavailable to the very users
   it was built for.
