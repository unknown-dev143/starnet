/* sidecar/channels/hub.js — the messaging BRIDGE (C5): inbound message -> the run host -> streamed reply back.

   This is the analogue of the reference harness's injected `_message_handler`: the ONE seam where a normalized InboundMessage
   drives the EXISTING run host (runOnce, extracted from handleRun) and the agent's reply is delivered back to
   the platform. The hub knows nothing of the loop/provider/broker internals — it is handed `runOnce`, the
   durable `store`, a `send`, the current `secrets` (OR key+model), and a `classify` (task-vs-talk), all injected.

     makeChannelHub({ channel, runOnce, store, send, secrets, persona, classify, ownerTrusted?, redact, emit, newId,
                      maxMessageLength?, agentPrefix? }) -> { onInbound, onCallback, onStatus }

   Per inbound it: (1) maps chatId -> a per-chat agentId (`tg_<chatId>`, isolated notebook/workspace/history);
   (2) loads the durable transcript, appends the user turn; (3) runs `runOnce` with surface:'autonomous' (a
   headless chat has no browser to answer a permission.prompt, so an ungranted mutation default-denies and the
   run continues — never stalls) UNLESS this chat opted into approve/deny buttons via `/approvals on`, in which
   case it runs 'interactive' and an ungranted mutation asks on the channel and fail-closes on silence (C6);
   (4) assembles the reply by concatenating agent.token deltas (the SAME contract
   harness.js uses in the browser — there is no agent.message event); (5) delivers it chunked to the platform's
   message-length limit; (6) emits channel.inbound / channel.delivery telemetry. One run per chat: a new message
   ABORTS the in-flight run for that chat and serves the latest (natural chat behavior). The existing per-run
   caps (maxIters/maxCostUsd/maxToolBytes) still bind — a messaging run is just another caller of runOnce.

   Pure + deterministic: every dependency is injected (no fetch/fs/clock/rng here); ids come from `newId`. */

     replying to their own "write the summary" with "do it now" means exactly that, and refusing would be its own

       the last remaining case of this channel delivering to the wrong place rather than merely doing less. Without
       the second, a reply in a busy group floats loose from its question.

       Ambient per chat rather than threaded through ~40 deliver() call-sites: the route is a property of the
       CONVERSATION, so /status, a consent card and the run's answer should all land in the same topic without
       each having to know it. Bounded (MAX_ROUTES, oldest evicted) because chatIds are unbounded.

       The quote is CONSUMED on first use; the thread is not. A quote answers one specific message, so a routine
       firing six hours later must not reach back and reply to it — but it should still land in the right topic.
       Fields are neutral ({ threadId, replyTo }); only telegram.transport.js knows the Bot API's names, and the

       edits the LAST message we saw in that chat. Anything older is somebody tidying history, not asking again.
       No record (a fresh boot) also declines — we cannot tell an ancient edit from a fresh one, and inventing a

       back twenty minutes later — a run that is still thinking is still marked.

       Purely cosmetic, and it must stay that way: transport-optional (a channel without reactions returns
       ok:false and we never try again for that run), every failure swallowed, and the clear is best-effort. The

    /* ---- LIVE STREAMING: the reply is written in front of you ------------------------------------------------
       Until now a long answer was a typing bubble followed, thirty seconds later, by a wall of text. This grows
       the reply in place: the first sentences go out as a real message, and each subsequent throttle window
       edits that same message with everything produced so far.

       THE INVARIANT, and the only one that matters: **exactly one complete reply, whatever fails.** Streaming is
       an optimisation on top of the existing deliver() path, never a replacement for it. Every failure mode
       converges on the same place:
         · cannot seed (send failed, channel cannot edit) -> streaming is dead for this run, deliver() sends
           normally, and nothing was left behind because nothing was sent;
         · an intermediate edit fails (429, a blip) -> skipped, the next window tries again, the final edit
           still carries the whole text;
         · the FINAL edit fails -> the stale partial is DELETED and the reply is sent whole, so the member never
           ends up reading half an answer sitting above the real one;
         · the reply outgrows one message -> streaming stops at the limit and deliver() chunks as it always did,
           with chunk 0 replacing the streamed message in place;
         · the run is superseded or E-STOPped -> the partial is deleted, because it answers a question that has
           been withdrawn.

       Both editMessage AND deleteMessage must be wired: arming the grow without the clean-up is what turns a
       failed edit into a duplicate reply. That pairing is also what keeps this Telegram-only for now — no other
       transport supplies either, so their behaviour is byte-identical. */

    /* OUR OWN MEMBERSHIP CHANGED — we were blocked, kicked, or let back in.
       This was invisible before: the notifier went on posting into a chat that could never receive it, every
       send failed, every failure queued another retry, and nothing in the product ever said why. The DETECTION
       was deliberately not built alone — a stamped field with no reader is one of this project's named bug
       classes — so it lands here with its consumer:

         · the chat is marked `unreachable`, which stops deliver() queueing anything new for it;
         · its already-queued backlog is dropped NOW, each with the same honest `redelivery-gave-up` delivery
           event a repeatedly-failed item gets. It is the same fact — we are not going to deliver this — and
           inventing a new event name would mean editing the owned shared/events.js contract.

       Clearing is not done here: `left` can arrive for reasons that are not a block, so the flag is lifted by
       the chat actually speaking again (processInbound), which is proof rather than inference. */
