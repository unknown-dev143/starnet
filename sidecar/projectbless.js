/* sidecar/projectbless.js — the ADD-A-PROJECT bless core (NS-5c Projects rail).

   POST /api/projects/bless {path} is the SECOND doorway to the SAME standing path-grant machinery as
   conversational path trust (pathtrust.js): the Commander types or picks a folder in the Projects rail and
   blessing it records the identical `path:<normalized-real-root>` grant + known-projects row — one consent
   flow, two doorways, never a parallel store. Here the CLICK is the consent, so unlike a run there is no
   mid-stream prompt() — but the exact same rules gate it:

     • INTERACTIVE ONLY. THE UNATTENDED RULE holds at this doorway too — an autonomous/headless caller can never
       widen its own reach through the API any more than through a tool. surface must be 'interactive' or DENY.
     • the identical HARDLINES (pathtrust's hardlineReason): no .env / .git internals, no NUL, no UNC/network path.
     • the path must EXIST and be a DIRECTORY (a typed path to a file or a missing folder is an honest error).
     • the blessed root is the PROPOSED git-repo root (detectRoot) — the same natural project boundary the
       conversational prompt offers — so blessing C:\proj\src\main.js blesses C:\proj, matching pathtrust.
       detectRoot STOPS AT THE HOME DIRECTORY (pathtrust's homeDir ceiling), so a dotfiles repo rooted at ~
       can never be proposed as the root for a folder under it: this doorway commits on the click with no
       card, so an overshoot here would grant the user's whole personal tree silently.

         /private/tmp) was recorded UN-canonical, while the run guard compares against the realpath. The two
         could never match: the rail happily reported 'added "<folder>"' and drew the row as a trusted project,
         and then the agent was denied on every file in it — a watched session re-raised the folder-trust card
         on EVERY file touch, and an unattended run hard-denied. That is exactly the consent-fatigue loop the

  /* PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS — the folder's OWN house rules (2026-07-27).

     projectScopeLine above tells the agent WHERE it is working. It never told it HOW that project wants to be
     worked in. Every serious codebase carries its conventions in a file at the root — AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md,
     .cursorrules — and until now StarNet read none of them at run time: `harness-import.js` parses AGENTS.md,
     but that is the one-time MIGRATION importer for adopting another harness's home, not live project context.
     So an agent anchored to the Commander's repo re-derived its conventions from scratch on every run, and
     violated the ones it could not guess.

     TRUST: gated on the SAME standing blessed-root grant as the folder line — an un-blessed or revoked root
     loads NOTHING. These files are Commander-owned instructions from a folder the Commander explicitly
     trusted, so they are injected as instructions rather than fenced as untrusted data; fencing them would
     defeat the entire point. They are still run through redact() on the way in, because a project file that
     pastes a key into a setup snippet must not carry it into the prompt.

     CACHE: this rides the SYSTEM prompt, which is the cached prefix. That is safe and deliberate — the text is
     read ONCE per run and is byte-stable for that run's lifetime, so it never shifts the prefix mid-run. It
     changes only when the Commander edits the file, which correctly costs one cache write. */
