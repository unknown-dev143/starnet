/* sidecar/station-bridge.js — ask the live station page to DO a station thing, and wait for its answer.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: sessions and crew are FRONTEND state. `App.openWorkstream`, `App.summonAgent`,
 * `App.selectAgent` and the workstream list all live in the page and persist through agent.save.json, while
 * agent TOOLS run here in the sidecar. So a tool that wants to open a session cannot just call a function —
 * it has to ask the page. This is that request/response channel, over the SSE hub the page already listens to.
 *
 * ⛔ THE HONESTY RULE THAT SHAPES THE WHOLE FILE: a headless run — cron, Night Shift, a channel message with
 * nobody looking at the station — has NO page attached. Every verb must then FAIL, visibly, with a reason. The
 * failure mode this design exists to prevent is a tool cheerfully reporting "opened a new session" into a
 * transcript when nothing happened, which is exactly the class of lie this product forbids. Silence times out;
 * it never resolves as success.
 *
 * Shape: emit `station.command` { id, verb, args } on the bus → the page runs it and POSTs the outcome to
 * /api/station/ack → we resolve the matching id. One in-flight map, one timeout, no retries (a retried
 * side-effect is a duplicated session).
