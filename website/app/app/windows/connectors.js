    /* SHAPE (2026-08-13, Andrew's call): "keys should just be the list of keys available and connected,
       and underneath should allow users to add custom keys." The pane was FIVE stacked top-level sections
       — two lists, then a whole platform DIRECTORY, then the form — measured at 1560px of scroll in a
       599px pane, so the add form (the pane's only verb) sat a full screen below the fold with a catalog
       wedged between it and the list it belongs to.
       Now: ONE list block, then the form. The two lists stay SEPARATE rows inside that block because they
       are not the same thing — a keyed CATALOG/MCP platform is read-only here and managed where it was
       added, a custom key is editable and deletable — but they are demoted from full section rules to the
       shared `.set-sub` label, which is what they always were: two groups of one list. Their counts stay
       SPLIT for the same reason the code already refuses to fake one: if the /api/connectors read fails
       we say so rather than assert a zero, and a single summed total could not stay honest through that.
       The curated platform directory now lives in CATALOG, where discovery belongs. Its cards route here
       and prefill this form; KEYS stays the inventory/setup surface for credentials the Commander actually
       holds, plus the escape hatch for a custom platform the catalog does not list. */
