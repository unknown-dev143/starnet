/* SPACESTATION — routinenudgestore.js : the "you keep launching this — schedule it?" nudge (lane D).

   A recipe the Commander keeps hand-launching is a routine that hasn't been admitted yet. This store watches
   the REAL per-recipe launch counters (ProspectStore.launches — the scout usage read) and, when a recipe
   crosses the launch floor and has NO live routine, gently offers ONCE to
   put it on a schedule. Accepting deep-links into the marketplace's SCHEDULE IT form (App.openRecipeLaunch:
   params prefilled by LaunchMemory, cadence preset, /api/cron/preview + the unattended-outbound warning all
   apply) — PROPOSE-AND-CONFIRM, never a silent cron write.

   Discipline (mirrors seedstore.js exactly): a gentle Chat.nudge, one offer per session, shares chat.js's
   single post-run beat slot (after suggestion/seed, before recruitment/curiosity), and a durable anti-nag
   ledger (own key): a recipe is offered at most OFFER_MAX times ever, and an explicit "not now" retires it
   for good. The cron check is a read-only cache of GET /api/cron refreshed off run-ends; while the cache is
   UNKNOWN the store stands down (fail-closed = no nag, never a duplicate-routine offer). READ-ONLY citizen:
   it never emits and never writes server state. node-exportable for its test. */

         This used to require `r.cadence` (the CATALOG AUTHOR's suggestion). But the station's own self-growing
         path — seedstore → Recipes.draft → saveCustom — mints every recipe with `cadence: null` (recipes.js
         draft()), so an agent-authored recipe the Commander went on to launch eight times by hand could NEVER
         earn "want it on a schedule?". The one recipe shape that PROVES a habit was the one shape structurally
         excluded from the habit nudge.
         The evidence for the offer was never the author's suggestion anyway — it is LAUNCH_FLOOR real
         hand-launches, which is exactly what the nudge cites. Nothing here fabricates a schedule: the offer
         states the count and nothing else, and accepting opens the SCHEDULE IT form where the Commander picks
         the cadence and sees the live next-fire preview before anything is written (propose-and-confirm).
         Launch SPACING is deliberately not inferred: the usage store keeps `n` and a single `lastAt`, so there
         is no interval to compute, and guessing one from a lone timestamp would be the fabricated schedule this
         lane exists to prevent. */
