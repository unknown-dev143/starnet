/* SPACESTATION — autojobs.js : the PURE engine for SELF-INITIATION (Slice 2 of the autonomy layer).

   The agent stops only ever waiting for orders: once it knows the Commander and they've turned autonomy on, it
   PROPOSES a few recurring STANDING JOBS grounded in what it knows — the Commander approves the ones they want, and
   each approved job becomes a scheduled cron routine that wakes unattended and leaves a draft on the desk.

   This is the deterministic skeleton; the model fills one narrow reasoning slot (what the jobs actually are). Same
   robustness pattern as the First Pitch (pitch.js): the gate, the directive, the strict parse, the cadence map, and
   the cron-body shape all live here (pure + tested); the live wiring (the model call, the approval beat, the POST to
   /api/cron) lives in autojobstore.js.

   THREE disciplines encoded so they can't rot:
     1. GROUNDING — every proposal MUST cite a specific dossier signal (a real goal / pain / ambition). No grounding,
        no candidate. This is the anti-slop floor: the station never invents busywork.
     2. ACHIEVABLE-NOW envelope — an unattended (autonomous-surface) run is default-denied tools/network/writes until
        a future Reach grant. So a Slice-2 job is REASONING/DRAFTING work the agent can do from what it knows and
        leave on the desk — never "search the web" / "send" / "write files" it can't actually do unattended yet. The
        directive constrains the model to that envelope (the confidence gate: don't propose what you can't deliver).
     3. POSTURE-GATED — proposing is itself a "propose" act, so it only happens when the autonomy Initiative is at
        least 'propose' (never at full wait-for-me). Graduation-first: it follows the one-time First Pitch.

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring pitch.js: an `AutoJobs` global in the browser, module.exports under node. NO
   Date.now / Math.random — proposals are a deterministic function of the dossier + the chosen cadence menu. */

     format gate. A model that invented "you mentioned wanting a weekly competitor digest" cleared it word for
     word, and the proposal did not merely get shown — approving it WRITES A CRON JOB that wakes unattended
     forever, under a beat whose whole copy is "now that i KNOW you". The sibling engine already refuses this:
     autopilot.js vetoes a candidate whose GROUNDS shares no significant token with anything the station knows.
     The evidence pool is the caller's obligation and the whole basis of the check — so, exactly like
     parseCandidates, a caller that supplies NO pool grounds NOTHING and every proposal dies. Fail-closed is the
     point: the failure mode this replaces was inventing standing work, not missing some.
