/* SPACESTATION — recquality.js : THE RECOMMENDATION QUALITY LOOP (pure, node-testable, zero DOM / zero fetch / zero clock).

   The spine (recommend.js) decides WHO speaks: one voice, evidence or silence. It answers "can this offer cite?"
   — a yes/no. This module answers the two questions that come after:

     1. HOW STRONG is that citation?  A pain corroborated twice this week is not the same evidence as a one-off
        remark from three weeks ago, and the station should not present them as if they were. `strength` is a
        0..1 read over evidence the station ALREADY holds (dimension confidence, belief freshness, a real repeat
        counter) — never a fabricated certainty. recommend.js turns it into a bounded WITHIN-TIER discount, so
        weak evidence speaks later, never louder. Absent state → null → neutral (no discount at all).

     2. IS THE BELIEF STILL TRUE?  A belief that is old AND thinly corroborated may not be ASSERTED in an offer
        ("because you said X") — but it is a perfectly good QUESTION ("still true that X?"). `staleness()` is
        that read. Stale memory becomes a source of good questions instead of confident bad recommendations.

   And it carries the arithmetic of the outcome loop (Q2): a per-channel EWMA quality weight that starts NEUTRAL
   and moves only on real, attributed outcomes, floored so quality alone can never silence a channel.

   Everything here is a pure function of state that already persists. The clock is INJECTED (`now`) exactly like
   understanding.js — it reads no clock and no randomness of its own — so staleness is deterministic and a node
   test can fast-forward time. The live wiring (browser storage, the bus, the attribution stamps) lives in
   recqualitystore.js. */

  /* ── EVIDENCE STRENGTH ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Strength is a 0..1 READ, never a score the station invents. Every producer below returns `null` when the
     state it reads is absent — and null means NEUTRAL everywhere downstream (recommend.js applies no discount).
     A cold station therefore ranks on pure priority, exactly as it did before this module existed. */

  /* NULL IS NOT ZERO (fixed 2026-08-04). `Number(null)`, `Number('')` and `Number(false)` are all a perfectly
     finite 0, so an explicit `conf: null` used to read as CONFIDENCE ZERO — which marked the belief stale and
     asked the Commander to re-confirm it — while an ABSENT conf correctly failed open to neutral. The same
     unreadable state has to fail open the same way whichever shape it arrives in.
     ALLOWLIST, NOT DENYLIST (2026-08-04). Listing the bad shapes ('' / null / boolean) still let `' '`, `[]` and
     `[0]` through as a hard 0 — the identical bug one shape further out. Only a real finite number, or a string

     This was the MEAN of the two readings, under a comment claiming "a well-understood dimension cannot rescue a
     belief the Commander last touched a season ago". The mean does not enforce that: a FIVE-YEAR-OLD belief in a
     0.9-confidence dimension still measured 0.45 — a middling score for a citation with no life left in it — and
     the mean's floor means age can never take the reading below 0.5 at all. Documenting that as a law the code
     did not have would have been the app asserting something it cannot prove, so the CURVE was fixed instead of
     the comment: this module exists to serve "stale asks, fresh asserts", and a shape where age cannot dominate
     cannot serve it.
     Now: strength = freshness × (0.5 + confidence/2). Confidence lives in [0.5 .. 1] as a MULTIPLIER, so it can
     only ever discount freshness — never manufacture it — which is the same law strength obeys everywhere else
     (weak evidence subtracts; strong evidence is not a bonus). The live finding that produced the mean survives
     exactly: a FRESH belief in a dimension reading conf 0 still scores 0.5, never 0, because the confidence read
     is a lagging aggregate and a seed-weighted belief scores 0 by design. Strength is a soft ordering signal. */

                        belief, ≈0.51 in understanding.js), i.e. nothing since has corroborated it.
     A PINNED belief is never stale — the Commander pinned it as durable truth and the station does not
     second-guess that. An UNDATABLE belief is never stale either: unknown age is not evidence (fail-open to
     "fresh", the same law understanding.js's freshness() follows). No clock is read here — `now` is injected,

     One channel-quality weight, an EWMA over the outcomes its ACCEPTED offers actually produced.

       start NEUTRAL (1) — a channel is never presumed good or bad; it has to earn either.
       FLOOR (0.5)       — quality alone can NEVER silence a channel. A dud channel gets structurally quieter and
                           still speaks when nothing better is on the table. Silencing is the job of the per-channel
                           caps and the Commander's own declines, never of a number the station computed.
       CAP (1.25)        — a proven channel earns a small edge, bounded well inside one priority tier (recommend.js
                           converts this whole range into a ±small WITHIN-TIER term), so no amount of good history
                           lets a gentle nudge outrank a turn-in. Priority order remains the spine's law.
