/* SPACESTATION — suggeststore.js : the browser wiring for ONGOING SUGGESTIONS (the recurring counterpart to the
   one-time First Pitch). Slice 3 of "the agent that points you."

   Where pitchstore.js fires ONCE (the graduation beat), this keeps the reverse value-flow alive: as the station
   keeps learning about its Commander (the dossier grows via curiosity/the interview), the agent occasionally
   offers ONE fresh, tailored, buildable idea — gently. It reuses the pure pitch engine for content
   (Pitch.buildDirective / parsePitch) and the same reason-only model path (Harness.chat, placed:[]) so the idea
   is grounded in what the agent genuinely knows (the live system prompt carries the dossier block).

   "Putting the pieces together" = anti-nag coordination. This does NOT pop the heavy Dialogue panel; it renders a
   GENTLE COMMS nudge (Chat.nudge), and it shares chat.js's single post-run beat slot with the curiosity nudge —
   chat.js cedes that one beat to a due suggestion (SuggestStore.willSuggest → fire) BEFORE asking curiosity, so
   the agent never stacks an idea and a question on the same task. The cadence (cooldown + per-session cap +
   only-when-the-dossier-grew) lives in the pure Pitch.shouldSuggest; this is just the live glue + the counter.

   Discipline mirrors curiositystore.js / pitchstore.js: READ-ONLY citizen of U.bus (subscribes to count tasks,
   NEVER emits), self-persists its own key (no save.js change), node-exportable for its test. */

           is only safe because the run's id arrives ASYNCHRONOUSLY. chat.js claims the pending stamp inside the
           stream's `onRunId` callback (RUN_META, recClaimRun), which fires after the network round-trip — well
           after doBuild() has returned and the noteAccept below has run. If onRunId ever became synchronous with
           Chat.send(), claimForRun would run against a still-empty `pending` and every suggestion-spawned run
           would silently lose its attribution. Locked by recqualitystore.test §10. */

             the stream is busy — the guard above correctly stops the attribution stamp being armed on work that
             never started, but then NOTHING happened: the loop learned nothing and the Commander was told
             nothing. They tapped "let's build it" and the beat simply vanished.
             What the harness can honestly say is exactly what a "not now" says — right idea, wrong moment — so
             that is the outcome folded, and the chip settles with one short line naming the real reason.
             `acceptedRecommendation` is cleared for the same reason the stamp is not armed: no run started, so
             the next unrelated run must not be recorded (onRunStart) as this recommendation's work.
             The ledger gets the same truth: NEXT.accepted permits `declined`, and the ledger's own fold
             (recommendation-ledger.js) explicitly treats declined/wrong_time as NEUTRAL, not negative — the
             exact "right idea, wrong moment" shape this is. Leaving the row terminal at `accepted` would have
             counted a launch that never happened as a positive preference signal forever.
             NOTE this branch keys on `launched` ALONE — a successful launch with RecQualityStore absent must
             never take the refused path (it would clear the accept and lie to the Commander mid-run). */
