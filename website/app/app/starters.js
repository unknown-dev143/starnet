/* SPACESTATION — starters.js : the PURE session-opener chip engine.

   The COMMS empty state used to show the same three chips forever ("what can you do here" /
   Recipes.list()[0] / "brief me on this station") — right for minute one, dead weight by day two.
   This engine picks the chips from what the station HONESTLY knows, client-side, at render time:

     • FRESH STATION (no session history anywhere, nothing ever launched) → the proven orientation
       set, unchanged: tour chip, first catalog recipe, station brief. First-run users need a map.
     • RETURNING COMMANDER → only chips EARNED by real prior activity, in this order, cap 3:
         1. their USUAL recipe — the most recently launched catalog recipe, chip carries the
            LaunchMemory values so the directive comes back prefilled (kill the retype tax);
         2. a cadence-DUE recipe — a 'morning' recipe, in the morning. Due-ness is the ONLY
            discovery left: the old day-rotated random catalog pick pushed recipes the
            Commander never asked for ("Release Notes" to someone who never shipped notes)
            and is gone. No signal → no chip.
         3. NEXT STEP on their most recent titled session — the one thing they were actually
            doing. The send is phrased like the pitch ask ("what you actually know") so it
            never presumes recall the agent may not have.
         4. "pitch me an idea" — leans on the existing dossier-grounded pitch surface: the live
            system prompt carries what the agent genuinely knows, so the answer is grounded.
       A returning Commander NEVER sees the orientation chips again — tour/brief are minute-one
       chips; a short row of earned chips beats a padded row of dead ones.

   HONESTY RULES: a chip only ever fills the composer (send/recipe-insert) — it never asserts
   station state, so nothing here can claim what the harness can't prove. "Usual" is defined as
   "you launched this, most recently" (LaunchMemory timestamps), never inferred. The while-away
   digest belongs to returnstore.js — this engine deliberately mints no catch-up chip.

   PURE + node-testable (a `Starters` global; module.exports under node): no DOM, no clock, no
   storage — the caller injects recipes, launch history, sessions and hour. Deterministic, never
   rng. Fail-open: bad/missing signals just mean fewer chips (fresh station → the classic set). */
