/* SPACESTATION — understanding.js : the PURE "how well the station understands its Commander" engine.

   The unifying CONFIDENCE layer over the Commander Dossier (dossier.js). Where dossier.summary()
   reports BREADTH (fraction of dimensions with any belief — dossier.js:166) and profile.summary()
   reports work-observation DEPTH (samples/24 — profile.js:114), this engine reports how well-GROUNDED
   the station's belief in each dimension is — folding belief count, provenance (Commander-authored /
   pinned vs study-observed), recency (stale beliefs decay, so drift lowers confidence on its own), and
   corroboration from real work. It rolls those into one honest `overall` understanding ∈ [0,1],
   weighted toward the north-star-critical dims (goals / ambition / pain), and names the single
   `weakest` dimension (highest weight × lowest confidence): the value-of-information target a rare
   earned question should aim at.

   TRUTHFUL TELEMETRY (the product's core law): understanding is derived ONLY from beliefs the station
   actually holds, decayed by staleness — it never fabricates certainty the harness can't prove. A cold
   station reads 0; a station whose beliefs have gone stale reads DOWN, never up. No autonomous belief
   revision happens here — this is a READ-MODEL over state that already persists (the dossier).

   PURE + testable, mirroring profile.js / dossier.js / xp.js: an `Understanding` global in the browser,
   module.exports under node. The clock is ALWAYS injected (`now`) — no Date.now / Math.random here — so
   decay is deterministic and node tests can fast-forward time. The browser wiring supplies Date.now()
   at the edge. */
