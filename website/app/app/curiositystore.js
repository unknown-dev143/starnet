/* SPACESTATION — curiositystore.js : the thin wiring around the pure just-in-time curiosity engine (curiosity.js).

   Holds the state the pure engine can't: the per-SESSION nudge count (in memory, resets each run of the app —
   keeps "one gentle ask per session"), the persisted set of dimensions the Commander has waved off (so a
   dismissed question never returns), AND a persisted per-dimension ASKED count (so a question shown-and-ignored
   across enough sessions stops for good — the fix for the "same question over and over" loop: an ignored nudge
   now leaves a DURABLE mark, not just an in-memory one that resets on reload). Self-persists to its own
   localStorage key (rides the backup prefix, like mintstore) — no save.js change. All the decision logic lives
   in curiosity.js; this is just the live read of the dossier's blank dimensions + the budget bookkeeping.
   NEVER emits on U.bus. */
