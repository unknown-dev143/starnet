/* SPACESTATION — maintquests.js : the PURE maintenance-quest generator (G1c) — wasted spend, turned into direction.

   SlagLog (slaglog.js) already diagnoses every unproductive run into a plain-English { reason, title, cause,
   fix } post-mortem and keeps a small ring of the recent ones. Those diagnoses go nowhere today. This engine
   folds that ring into playable direction: when the SAME cause bites REPEATEDLY, the station mints ONE
   maintenance quest carrying the diagnosis + the actionable fix:

     "⚑ 3 runs died on max_iters — split the task or raise the iteration budget"

   The honest-quest + XP laws, encoded so they can't rot:
     • THRESHOLD-GATED — a one-off failure never nags. A cause must appear at least MIN_HITS (default 2) times
       in the live ring before it mints (a real, recurring problem, not a blip).
     • ONE OPEN QUEST PER CAUSE — the same recurring reason never duplicates (dedup key = the reason).
     • DISMISSAL = STOP FOREVER — a waved-off maintenance quest never re-renders and never re-fires, even if
       the cause keeps biting (the anti-nag law: the station suggests a fix, it never pushes).
     • HONEST COMPLETION — no claim button. A minted quest completes the instant the SIGNAL CLEARS: the cause's
       count in the live ring falls back below MIN_HITS. This is provable from the ring alone (a bounded window
       of the most-recent post-mortems): as clean/other runs push the failing runs out of the ring, the count
       falls — the operator genuinely fixed the line. (We pick this over an N-clean-runs counter because it
       reads straight off the same ring the mint reads, so mint and completion can never disagree.)
     • NO XP — a maintenance quest pays out the real fix landing on the floor + the shared celebration, never
       points.

   Also home to a small non-slag maintenance source: a repeatedly-SKIPPED cron routine (feature 4a's JAM). The
   store folds a jam signal in via record() with a synthetic reason ('cron-jam:<jobId>') so it rides the exact
   same dedup + projection + dismissal as a slag cause — one quest shape, never a parallel system.

   PURE + node-testable (mirrors stationquests.js / queststate.js): no Date.now / Math.random — the caller
   injects the clock and the live ring/counts. The browser store (maintqueststore.js) owns the live reads
   (World.slagPostmortems, the cron-jam tally); this file owns only the deterministic fold + the projection
   into the shared Quests shape. */

         new recurrence is a new problem worth surfacing again (unlike a one-time gap that stays fixed once the
         prop is placed; a maintenance issue can recur). A fresh firstSeenAt is stamped so the card reads current.
