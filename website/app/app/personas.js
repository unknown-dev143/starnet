/* SPACESTATION — personas.js : PERSONALITY archetypes for agents (the "how it TALKS" axis).

   Each agent carries a personaId (default 'confidant') plus optional voiceTraits (the fine-tune
   dials) and an optional customVoice string. composeSystemPrompt() in app.js folds the result of
   Personas.compose(id, traits, custom) into the system prompt — AFTER the identity (which carries
   the load-bearing "you have REAL tools" clause) and BEFORE the purpose — so personality colours
   the delivery without ever talking the agent out of doing the work.

   These archetypes are deliberately GROUNDED — voices a real operator would actually want running
   their station, not cutesy mascots. Each one self-scopes its flavour to conversation and explicitly
   defers to the work when there's a real task, so task fidelity is unchanged. The trait dials and the
   free-text box let the Commander tune the voice past the preset — every dial emits real prompt text
   (no fakery). `voiceParams` is the older human-readable descriptor kept for the create screen;
   `sampleVoiceReply` shows how the preset answers "what are you up to" in voice mode; `cardLine` is the
   one-liner shown on the create screen so picking a voice is fun.

   THE AUDIBLE VOICE IS NOT A PERSONA PROPERTY. Personality changes the WORDS (promptInjection) and the
   ambient flavour lines — never the sound. Every agent speaks with the single locked STATION VOICE below. */

  /* THE STATION VOICE — locked (Andrew, 2026-07-12): every persona speaks as ULTRON.
     Recipe (Andrew-locked 2026-07-05, ear-tuned live in the voicelab; ported verbatim from the old
     'direct'/'calm' presets): Algenib — the only gravelly Gemini voice — at natural speed, NO pitch-drop,
     pushed through the machine-shell FX (voice.js applyShellAmounts: metal 1.0 / digitize 0.4 / reverb 0.6).
     ttsStyle is the natural-language delivery instruction the sidecar folds into the TTS input

     change what the agent says, never how its voice sounds — do not add per-persona overrides back. */
