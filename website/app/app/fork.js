/* SPACESTATION — fork.js : the PURE engine for MID-TASK PREFERENCE FORKS (R1 — questions that ARE work).

   When an agent hits a genuine fork whose answer is a DURABLE preference (format, tone, ask-first vs
   run-with-it — never a one-off task detail), it may ask ONCE instead of guessing: the question rides its
   normal reply (ending the turn — the honest mechanic; no fake mid-stream pause), the Commander answers via
   chips at the run boundary, and the pick does double duty — it steers the task immediately AND banks into
   the dossier's style dimension as a Commander-authored belief (the highest-quality evidence there is:
   given in context, about a real decision, immediately acted on).

   SELF-RETIRING by construction: the fork instruction only enters the system prompt while the style model's
   confidence is LOW (the same understanding.js floor that aims the VOI question and the belief probes) —
   once the station knows how the Commander likes work done, the forks stop appearing at all. The system
   asks LESS the longer it's used.

   This engine is the pure half: the directive block, the reply-marker parser, the confidence gate, and the
   banked-belief composer. The live wiring (prompt injection, chip render, dossier commit) lives in app.js /
   chat.js. PURE + node-testable, mirroring pitch.js / curiosity.js: a `Fork` global in the browser,
   module.exports under node. No clocks, no randomness. */

  //                 KEEPING both: a slightly redundant chip is a blemish, destroying a real alternative is a bug.
