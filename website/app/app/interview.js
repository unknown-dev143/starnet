/* SPACESTATION — interview.js : the PURE engine for THE INTAKE INTERVIEW (Commander Dossier, Phase B).

   The station actively gets to know its Commander: a short, optional, skippable Q&A — one question per
   blank dossier dimension — whose answers become durable dossier beliefs. This is the "deeply research the
   user" move made real (the user is asked directly; nothing is inferred and nothing reaches outside the
   conversation). The flow/COMMS half lives in intake.js (a thin controller mirroring onboarding.js); ALL
   the decision logic — which questions to ask, in what order, and how an answer becomes a belief — lives
   here, pure + node-testable (a `Interview` global in the browser, module.exports under node).

   The question DIMENSIONS are kept in lockstep with dossier.js's DIMS by interview.test.js, so a typo can
   never silently drop a belief into a non-existent dimension. Voice = the awakening's WRY GENIUS, lighter:
   a peer catching up on who it works for, never a form. */

  // one question per dimension (dims mirror dossier.js DIMS — enforced by the test). `chips` are
  // domain-agnostic quick answers (tap) OR the user types their own; a `skip` chip carries an empty value.
  // PLAIN-QUESTION LAW (Andrew, 2026-07-20, supersedes the V3 "scene register"): every question is an
  // extraction instrument — literal, single-reading, zero metaphors, zero decode-work. A misunderstood
  // question yields a sideways answer that gets SAVED as context and corrupts every downstream surface.
  // Concrete beats abstract, but concrete means PLAIN ("what do you spend most of your time doing?"),
  // never poetic. Chip taps still land as weight 'seed' (beliefFromAnswer) —
  // prompt-informing, never gate-opening; only their typed words are 'stated'.

  /* ⛔ A TYPED SKIP IS A SKIP. The interview's own opening line invites it — "answer or tap, 'skip' anything" —
     and the chip is literally labelled `skip`, so typing the word is the behaviour the copy TEACHES. But a
     skip was recognised only from the CHIP (`explicitSkip`) or an empty string, so the typed word fell through
     as the Commander's own words and was written to the dossier at weight 'stated' — the strongest belief the
     station holds, the one that opens the readiness gate and rides every prompt. The Commander's stated goal
     for the month became "skip".
