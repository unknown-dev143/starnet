     Until now every reader of an agent's stats was a display surface: the level chip, the dossier, /whoami.
     Nothing in the station ACTED on them, so a TRUSTED veteran and a stranger were identical to delegation —
     which is what made the whole leveling system feel cosmetic. This publishes each agent's EARNED track
     record onto the roster, where the sidecar renders it on the lead's team.dispatch briefing, so the lead
     picks a worker on evidence instead of on nothing.

     It INFORMS, it never GATES: no level threshold blocks a dispatch, an unproven agent is simply described
     without a track line (Xp.credential returns '' until something is actually earned), and the Commander can
     still hand any work to anyone. The sandbox law holds.

     WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE CACHED SYSTEM PROMPT: the plan originally aimed this at rosterClause(), but that
     line is baked into the stored a.systemPrompt and needs a recomposeOrchestrators() to refresh — the
     documented cached-prompt trap (see the note above rosterClause). The sidecar's [ORCHESTRATION] briefing is
     rebuilt from the roster on EVERY run instead, so it is the same list the lead actually picks from with
     none of the staleness risk. Duplicating a slow-moving copy into the cached prompt as well would buy
