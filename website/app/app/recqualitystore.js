/* SPACESTATION — recqualitystore.js : THE OUTCOME LOOP (the live half of the recommendation quality loop).

   The spine picks the best-grounded offer it can cite. This store answers the question nobody was asking before
   it existed: DID THAT OFFER ACTUALLY HELP? A channel whose accepted offers produce work the Commander rates 👎
   — or work that never finishes — gets structurally quieter. A channel whose offers produce 👍 work earns a
   small, bounded edge. Nobody hand-tunes anything; the same earned-trust philosophy the autonomy dial already
   uses, applied to the station's own suggestions.

   HOW AN OUTCOME IS ATTRIBUTED (and why it can't be faked):
     1. The Commander ACCEPTS an offer, AND the launch that accept triggers really starts. Only then does the
        channel arm a PENDING stamp ({ channel, dim, id, at }) — an accept whose launch no-opped (a busy stream)
        arms nothing, because there is no work to attribute. It is not silent either: the caller settles that
        refusal as `deferred` on the spot (right idea, wrong moment) and tells the Commander why.
     2. The very next hero run START claims it (chat.js, at the same point it writes RUN_META) — so the stamp is
        visible on the run's own meta, and the run is the provable link between "the offer" and "the work". The
        stamp EXPIRES after PENDING_TTL_MS: past that window the next run is not this offer's work, and saying it
        was would be the app asserting a causal link the harness cannot prove.
     3. The run's real outcome folds back: a clean finish is a weak positive; the Commander's own 👍/👌/👎 on that
        run (the direct rateWork hand-off, never the bus) is the strong one.
     Where an accept spawns NO trackable work (a kept belief, an answered question, a re-confirm), the accept
     itself IS the outcome — a small positive, recorded once.

   TRUTHFUL TELEMETRY, the version that matters here:
     · Weights start NEUTRAL and move ONLY on outcomes the harness can actually name and attribute. A run that
       ended in a stop / an error / a budget limit folds NOTHING — the station cannot honestly blame the offer
       for that, so it says nothing about it.
     · The floor (recquality.js Q_FLOOR ≥ 0.5) means quality alone can never silence a channel. Silencing is the
       job of the per-channel caps and the Commander's own declines — never of a number the station computed.
     · Nothing user-facing ever asserts a quality score. It orders offers; it does not narrate them.
     · TWO CHANNELS ARE EXEMPT BY DESIGN and record no outcomes: `memory` (the run's own reflection deck) and
       `rate` (the rating of work just done). Neither is a suggestion the station CHOSE to make — the run earns
       them — which is the same reason recommend.js exempts both from the session ask budget. They sit permanently
       neutral, and that is correct: there is no "was this offer worth making?" to answer about them. Every
       channel that DOES choose to interrupt records both directions (accept and decline), so no recording
       channel can drift down merely for being measured.

   Discipline mirrors curiositystore / suggeststore: a READ-ONLY citizen of the event spine (subscribes to
   agent.run.end, NEVER emits — the frozen shared/events.js contract is owned elsewhere), self-persists its own
   key (no save.js change), node-exportable for its test. The pure arithmetic lives in recquality.js. */

     THE STAMP EXPIRES (fixed 2026-08-04). It is claimed by the first hero run WITHIN PENDING_TTL_MS of the accept,
     and by nothing after that. Without the clock the stamp simply waited — so an accept whose launch never
     happened stayed armed indefinitely and the Commander's next unrelated manual run, minutes or hours later,
     was recorded as the work that offer produced. An expired stamp settles as `deferred`: the offer was accepted
     and no work followed it, which is a real, mild signal about this channel — and it is the ONLY thing the
     harness can honestly say about it.
     EXPIRY IS LAZY, AND THAT IS THE HONEST SCOPE OF IT. Nothing runs on a timer: an armed stamp is only ever
     examined here, so it folds its `deferred` when (and only when) a LATER HERO RUN STARTS. A session where the
     Commander accepts an offer, the launch never happens, and they then start no further run records nothing —
     and `pending` is memory-only, so a reload drops it entirely. Both are deliberate: the alternative is a timer
     that writes a verdict about an offer while the Commander is away from the keyboard, on no new evidence.
     A run REFUSED at the moment of accept is a different case and is settled eagerly at the call site
