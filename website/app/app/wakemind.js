/* SPACESTATION — wakemind.js : the PURE engine for the LIVE half of THE AWAKENING (Interview 2.0).

   The awakening used to be a form wearing a costume: six fixed questions, fixed options, canned
   acknowledgments — the agent never actually LISTENED. This engine gives the ceremony a real mind:
   the agent's reactions and its read of the Commander are REASONED by the live model, not templated.

   Four moments live here (directive → tolerant parse, exactly the pitch.js pattern):
     1. THE PAIN REPLY — after the Commander names the work they want gone, the agent reacts to their
        SPECIFIC words (proof it heard) and asks ONE targeted follow-up that pulls the bigger picture
        behind the chore — the project/business it serves and who they are in it. This replaces the old
        broad "tell me about your world" context question (the banned it-depends shape) with a question
        grounded in what the Commander just said.
     2. THE AMBITION REPLY — same shape after the shelf answer: react to the SPECIFIC ambition, then ONE
        follow-up that makes it concrete (what it actually is / who it's for / the first real piece).
        The canned "noted." used to end this beat exactly where the richest material — their projects
        and ideas — was sitting on the table; now the agent digs, once.
     3. THE SYNTHESIS — after pain + follow-up + ambition (+ its dug detail), the agent speaks its READ
        back ("here's my read…") and authors its OWN purpose.md from it. The Commander confirms or
        corrects. This replaces the old 5-option PURPOSE picker: the mission is derived from real
        context, not chosen from a menu. (Reverse value flow, applied to onboarding itself.)
     4. THE CONFIRM — always exactly two choices: "that's me" or a correction path. Never a menu.

   HARD RULE (awakening-question-design): every question this engine emits must be concrete + targeted,
   answerable in one breath from the Commander's real life — never abstract, never "it depends". The
   directives encode that rule so the model can't drift back to "what does good look like".

   Honest degradation: every consumer treats a null parse as "the mind is quiet" and falls back to the
   scripted ceremony (canned acks + the classic purpose question). No key, offline, slow, or unparseable
   ⇒ the awakening still lands, exactly as before.

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring pitch.js / curiosity.js: a `WakeMind` global in the browser,
   module.exports under node. NO Date.now / Math.random / IO — same ctx in, byte-identical directive out. */
