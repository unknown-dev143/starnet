/* SPACESTATION — permissions.js : the PURE engine for the PERMISSIONS PANEL (autonomy Stage B / B1).

   The user-facing "how autonomous" SPECTRUM + the curated catalog of standing capability grants. This is the
   trust UX the Commander picked: an OS-style panel where they dial the station from "never acts on its own" all
   the way to "fully autonomous" (acts AND writes real local files), and where every standing grant is visible
   and revocable.

   THE SPECTRUM is one legible choice that composes TWO underlying systems coherently:
     • POSTURE (autonomy.js) — the INITIATIVE intent (wait→propose→leash→free), set via a cadence PRESET.
     • CONSENT (sidecar grantsPermanent) — the standing capability GRANTS (cabinet:write = real local writes).
   A level sets both. The GRANT is what separates "draft for me" from "fully autonomous": both intend to work
   locally (reach=sandbox), but only the top level holds the cabinet:write consent that lets a write actually land.

       never   → preset wait    + no grants   → does nothing on its own
       suggest → preset suggest + no grants   → proposes; you approve
       draft   → preset build   + no grants   → acts + leaves finished drafts on the desk (today's Stage A)
       full    → preset free    + cabinet:write → acts AND writes real files into its own workspace, on its own

   LOCAL-ONLY by design: the only grantable class is cabinet:write (jailed fs writes; .env/.git always blocked;
   every write checkpointed + reversible). Never send / publish / spend / execute — those aren't on the spectrum.

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring autonomy.js: a `Permissions` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO Date.now / Math.random — every output is a deterministic function of (level | posture+grants). The store
   owns the live api calls + the AutonomyStore hand-off. */
