  /* THE ONE STEP A HAND-SUMMONED AGENT LEAVES TO THE COMMANDER (2026-08-03).
     A specialist summoned from the Recruitment Bay arrives with NO desk — deliberately, so the Commander chooses
     where it sits — and until it has one it cannot take floor work. That required step used to be printed ONCE by
     summonAgent: a DOM-only line, so the first stream switch or reload erased the only place it was ever stated
     (load() rebuilds the log from ws.history, and a local line is not history), and any live beat dropped it
     outright. A brand-new agent's session was then indistinguishable from any other empty stream.
     It is now a property of the STREAM: every open of a deskless specialist's session states the step and offers
     the door. The claim is re-derived from the live floor (App.needsWorkstation) on every load, never stored — so
     it cannot outlive the desk it asks for, and cannot assert a floor state the station can't prove.
     Anti-nag: it is one system line + the chip row that answers it, in the session that owes the desk, and it is
     silent while that stream is mid-run (the run owns its own DOM; the prompt returns on the next open). */
  // REFIT can satisfy the prompt while this stream remains open. Its text is a derived floor claim, not history,
  // so retire both of its DOM rows as soon as the live floor proves the desk now exists. Keep every unrelated

       3. the batch landed on a NON-displayed stream -> a soft notify, no card, no control.
       4. a focused panel (the tutorial's Dialogue on the FIRST command, an intake interview) held the

     Simple by design: the headline, the honest verification line, the link that RUNS it FIRST (when a

     files in the default deliverables folder; and when the deliverable is a PLAN rather than the finished thing,
     it then RUNS the build that does the work — see `buildable` below), Later (dismiss; the session stays), Discard (single confirm →
     wipe + denylist). A typed message rides the decision as a REAL user turn in this same session — the
     session id IS the shift's durable streamId, so the agent replies with the build's actual transcript
     behind it. Decided cards vanish(); the outcome persists as a sys marker (opts.noteDecision).

  /* A MULTI-LINE NUDGE IS A LIST, NOT A PARAGRAPH (2026-08-04).
     The night-shift report composes a real ledger — a headline, the acts that fired, the acts it DECLINED, the
     builds waiting — hands it to nudge() as one '\n'-joined string, and `white-space: pre-wrap` turned it into a
     wall. Two things broke. Every wrapped continuation fell back to the left margin, so "✓ drafted the note —
     waiting in your outbox" read as two separate items; and the sub-items' leading spaces were the only thing
     expressing nesting, which a narrow COMMS column eats. Worse for a truthfulness surface: a DECLINED act
     rendered identically to a completed one.
     Each marked line now gets its own row — marker in its own box (the symbol-glyph law: ✓ ✗ ⚒ come from the
     fallback face, so they are BOX-centred and never sized off the text's metrics) and the prose in a
     minmax(0,1fr) column, which is what buys the hanging indent. A refusal is its own rank. A single-line nudge

  /* ══ THE RECOMMENDATION PASS — one listener, one arm point, one arbiter (spine S3) ═══════════════════
     Every proactive channel used to own an `agent.run.end` listener and win the single post-run beat by
     ARMING EARLIEST (nudge/rate 650ms, study 12s, arc 14s, trust 16s, thread 18s), so the priority order
     baked into beatcard.js was inert and the least valuable ask usually spoke. Now every channel offers a
     CANDIDATE built from its existing SYNC predicate, the pure spine (recommend.js) ranks them, and exactly
     ONE fires through its existing render path.

     A candidate must carry two things or it does not exist:
       • kind — its place in the one priority order (Recommend.PRIORITY).
       • why  — its evidence, derived from REAL state: the Commander's own words, a real persisted counter,
                or the dimension actually being targeted. Recommend.pick() DROPS anything that can't cite.
                A channel that cannot say WHY stays silent — truthful telemetry, applied to recommendations.

     Nothing about the per-channel floors moved: every session cap, denylist, dedup and stand-down still
     lives in that channel's own store and is spent by its own fire path. The spine only decides WHO speaks.
     A channel that LOSES the moment is not consumed — study/thread go back on their FIFO queues, and every
     other channel's predicate simply reads true again at the next task end. */
  /* ── TWO ARMS, ONE ARBITER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     A single 1.6s arm was WRONG for half the channels, in a way that silently broke two of them:

       · MEMORY WINS was a fiction. memory.proposed is emitted only after the sidecar's reflection aux call
         returns — SECONDS after the run ends. At 1.6s the slot was still free, a turn-in claimed it, and the
         consent deck the Commander actually cares about queued behind a lower-value card, invisible.
       · THE STUDY STASH WASN'T WRITTEN YET. /api/study/proposals falls back to the agent's PREVIOUS batch
         when this run's isn't stashed, so at 1.6s every study card offered the LAST run's belief and each
         run's own batch never got offered at its own moment. Same for the thread mine.

     So the pass runs TWICE per run end, and each channel collects at the arm where its evidence is real:

       FAST (1.6s) — the RATE beat only. It needs nothing but the run's own work counters, which are already
         on hand, and it is the beat the Commander is waiting for; this also restores the precedence the old
         650ms ladder gave it, without letting it win by being early (it is still ranked, not raced).
       SLOW (12s)  — everything the run must first PRODUCE: the fetch-backed turn-ins (study, thread), the
         arc and trust offers, and the gentle channels. 12s is the old STUDY_ARM_MS reality — by then
         reflection has landed (or reserved the slot) and both stashes are written. The arc gets its focused
         Dialogue at this arm too, rather than popping 1.6s after the reply.

     memory is unchanged and needs no arm: memory.proposed RESERVES the slot the instant it fires, so a turn-in
     that hasn't rendered yet stands down, and one that HAS already rendered is queued behind — never replaced. */
  const BEAT_ARM_MS = 1600;          // FAST arm — the rate beat (nothing to wait for)
  const BEAT_SLOW_ARM_MS = 12000;    // SLOW arm — reflection has landed and both stashes are written

  /* ── EVIDENCE STRENGTH (quality loop, Q1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     The spine asks "can this candidate cite?". These ask "how STRONG is that citation?" — read from state the
     station already holds (recquality.js: dimension confidence, belief freshness, a real repeat counter), never
     computed fresh and never fabricated. recommend.js turns the reading into a bounded WITHIN-TIER discount, so
     thin evidence speaks later — it can never move a candidate across a priority band.

     Fail-open at every step: no module / no store / nothing to read → null → NO adjustment at all, and the
     station ranks exactly as it did before the quality loop existed.

     WHO REPORTS, AND WHY THAT MATTERS. Strength only ever SUBTRACTS, so a channel that reports one is the only
     kind that can be down-ranked by it — silence is a relative advantage. Every channel with honest data to read
     therefore reads it:
       · ARC     — its cited goal belief's freshness × the goals dimension's corroboration.
       · SEED / ROUTINE — the real repeat / hand-launch counter behind the citation.
       · STUDY   — the CONFIDENCE of the dimension the proposal targets. (Deliberately not the belief's AGE: a
                   RETIRE proposal is most valuable exactly when the belief it targets is oldest, and its
                   directive citation is fresh by construction — this is the dimension read, not a freshness one.)
       · TRUST   — the offer's own provenance confidence, the real satisfaction percentage it cites, 0..100 → 0..1.
     And the ones that genuinely have nothing to read, stated rather than left implicit:
       · CURIOSITY asks ABOUT a dimension rather than asserting one, so a blank dim is a high-VALUE question, not
         weak evidence — precisely what the spine's VOI term already scores. A strength read here would double-count
         the same blankness with the opposite sign.
       · THREAD has no dim at all (a mined idea is not aimed at a dossier dimension) and its quote is located in
         the run that just ended, so there is no age and no confidence to read. Neutral is the honest reading.
       · The RE-CONFIRM ask carries none by design: strength discounts a weak ASSERTION, and an ask asserts nothing.
     The residual tradeoff is real and is not papered over: suggest / recruit / thread / curiosity and the
     re-confirm ask cannot be discounted for thin evidence, so within a band they hold a small structural edge over
     the reporters at their weakest. That is the price of never fabricating a reading, and it is bounded by
     STRENGTH_MAX (recommend.js) — never a band crossing.

     Fail-open at every step: no module / no store / nothing to read → null → NO adjustment at all, and the

  /* ---- ARGUMENT-VALUE COMPLETION -------------------------------------------------------------------
     The palette completed command NAMES but never argument VALUES, so `/model ` offered nothing of the 345
     warmed ids and `/personality ` never named the seven options — you had to run the bare command, read the
     list, then retype.

     The derivation trick is taken from the reference harness (© 2025 Nous Research, MIT — see NOTICE.md):
     it builds a static completion list straight out of each command's args_hint by pulling the
     pipe-separated pattern out of it, so a command declaring "[on|off|status]" gets completion for free with
     no per-command wiring. We do the same against our own `argsHint`, then layer live providers over the top
     for the sets only a running station knows (models, personalities, workstreams, recipes).

     ENTER STILL DISPATCHES THE COMMAND. Completion is bound to TAB only. The palette's Enter contract is
     load-bearing — a regressed Enter is exactly what fired "/personality direct" at the model as chat
     (2026-07-05), and test/slash.palette.test.js + the J7 journey guard it. */

  /* ═══════════════ WORK LINES IN COMMS (agentic graphs) ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
     A directive typed here lands at ONE dock. If the Commander drew belts PAST that dock, those stages are
     the work — and until this existed they were scenery on this surface while channel and cron work ran the
     whole line. The sidecar advances its own lines because it owns those turns; a COMMS turn streams through
     /api/run to the BROWSER, which owns it, so the browser asks the SAME router the same question
     (/api/routing/chain) and runs the same hops with the SAME shared handoff prompt. One floor, one answer,

           workflow is running." A COMMS directive is a DIRECT ORDER handed to an agent in person; it did not
           arrive through any line's trigger, so it is TERMINAL at the dock that answers it — no downstream
           stage runs, nothing is spent past this agent, and the floor draws no handoff. `wsLineOrigin` is
           the origin line a turn entered on: today only line-triggered work carries one, and every such
           trigger (a channel message routed down the belts, a routine, the sample job, a crate at an INBOX)
           runs its line INSIDE the sidecar, where the origin is provable. The sidecar applies the identical
