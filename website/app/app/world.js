/* SPACESTATION — world.js : the LIVE station the agent lives inside.

   Renders the player-built WorldModel station (multi-room) with the generalized
   procedural bake (stationbake.js), under a pan/zoom camera. The agent has a
   workstation in its spawn room and ACTUALLY WALKS the rooms + corridors — pathing
   through doors via the model's BFS path() — to reach its seat when given a task,
   then wanders the whole reachable station when idle. Edits made in REFIT build mode
   re-bake the world live (the agent re-homes if the floor under it is reclaimed).

   Coordinate frame: everything here is in the bake's LOCAL tile frame (tile*TILE px);
   the camera maps local→screen. The WorldModel's world/local offset is handled inside
   projectGeometry(); when the station grows north/west the origin shifts and the agent
   is translated to stay put. */

  /* APERTURE (2026-07-27) — `vig` and `over` govern how much of the panel the picture actually gets, and are
     independent of `curve` (which only decides how hard it bows).
       vig  — strength of the in-canvas radial vignette, 1 − vig·r². This is the DOMINANT darkener of the feed:
              r=1 at the edge midpoints and √2 at the corners, so the shipped 0.55 cut the edges to 45% and
              clamped the corners to literal ZERO, long before any CSS glass was composited on top. Lowering it
              is what actually gives the border back.
       over — output overscan. The warp's inverse ro = rs·(1 − k·rs²) has a maximum reach of (2/3)/√(3k) = 1.283
              at k=0.09, but a rect's corner sits at √2 = 1.414 — so those pixels had NO source to sample and
              both paths hard-filled them black. That is the rounded-oval crop, not a soft vignette. Dividing
              the output radius by ≥ √2/1.283 = 1.103 brings the corners back inside the domain; 1.12 leaves
              margin. The cost is ~11% of edge content, never any change to the curvature.
     Both feed the GL path and the CPU LUT path IDENTICALLY — drawCurveGL's probe compares the two and defects

  /* ---------- USE_BEAT: what USING a prop actually looks like (2026-08-08 idle-life pass) ----------
     Every leisure prop used to resolve to the SAME beat: stand (or sit) on the approach tile, hold
     for a flat 10-22s, fidget on the generic cadence. A pinball table and a bookshelf were the same
     behavior with different pixels behind the body — the props were scenery the agent happened to
     stand near, not things it DID anything with.

     Each row tunes the dials the beat actually has, keyed by the catalog's `use.kind`:
       dwell   [min,max] ms at the prop — how long the thing holds you
       fidget  [min,max] ms between the small look-away flicks (fast = engaged/twitchy, slow = absorbed)
       track   true = while dwelling, keep glancing at the prop's own animation (fish, holo pet,
               the arcade screen) instead of around the room.
     A kind with no row keeps the old generic beat, so adding a `use` row to the catalog never
     requires touching this table (same contract as USE_LINE).

     ⛔ NO GESTURE TRACK HERE. A first cut fired the sets' one-shot `gesture` animation on arrival
     and on a loop at the "active" machines, on the theory that it was a generic arm movement. It is
     not: that track is an arms-up STRETCH, so what shipped was an agent walking up to the arcade
     cabinet and stretching in front of it (Andrew, 2026-08-08: "makes 0 sense... it just walks up to
     the machines and starts stretching"). REUSING AN ANIMATION FOR SOMETHING IT DOES NOT DEPICT
     READS AS A BUG, NOT AS LIFE. A real "playing the machine" pose is new ART, not a flag in this
     table — until that art exists the honest beat is: stand at it, face it, and hold. */

     noise (the body strobed between two poses), and a real turn teleported the pose 90° in a single frame.

  /* ---------- CANVAS-LOSS RECOVERY — the station may never silently go black ----------
     Andrew, 2026-08-15, on 0.10.2: "the station randomly went black and the only thing that
     appears is the agents, and the props."

     That symptom names its own cause precisely. Every layer that is NOT redrawn from scratch
     each frame lives in an offscreen <canvas>: the station bake (floors, walls, hull + the
     lightmap), the SpaceBG sky, the Terrain ground. Agents draw from <img> sprite sheets and
     props draw procedurally, so those two are rebuilt on every single frame — and those two
     are exactly what survived.

     A GPU/driver reset — sleep-wake, a display or DPI change, a TDR, the WebView's GPU process
     restarting — zeroes the backing store of every accelerated 2D canvas in the page. The
     canvas OBJECTS survive at full size, their PIXELS do not, and NO exception is thrown. So
     nothing downstream can tell: `cache` is still a well-formed bake, and frameBody blits a
     fully transparent plate over a base fill, every frame, forever. It never heals on its own,
     because a bake only re-runs when the GEOMETRY changes and no geometry changed.

     Two defences, because they fail on different days:
       1. the CONTEXT EVENTS ('contextlost'/'contextrestored', wired in init) — the browser
          telling us directly. Correct and instant when the runtime bothers to fire them.
       2. this WATCHDOG — a pixel the bake painted opaque, re-read at most once a second. It
          needs no cooperation from the runtime, so it also catches a plate that was dropped
          without an event (and any future regression that blanks the bake).
     The probe costs one 1x1 readback a second, against a frame it saves entirely. */

     User report, 2026-08-24: the whole viewport black — no agents, no props — HUD alive,
     every 10-20 minutes, permanent until an app restart. The bake watchdog above cannot see
     that mode: it probes the OFFSCREEN bake plate, and in this failure the offscreen caches
     are fine — it is the VISIBLE stage's own 2D context that died. A dead 2D context no-ops
     every draw call silently, so the loop keeps "painting" a canvas that displays nothing.
     preventDefault() on 'contextlost' asks the browser to restore it, but when
     'contextrestored' never arrives (repeated GPU-process resets do this) the page holds the
     only reference to a context that will never work again. The ONLY recovery then is a new
     canvas element with a new context — invalidating caches cannot help.

     Detection is the same philosophy as the bake sentinel: the frame's last act paints ONE
     opaque black pixel at (0,0) (invisible — that corner is vignetted space). A live context
     leaves alpha 255 there; a dead one leaves the transparent void of its zeroed backing

     An idle body used to decide and step off in the SAME frame, so the decision was invisible: the viewer saw
     translation, never intent, and a fully-reasoned move (the want engine always has a reason) read as drift.
     Now the instant an idle-life walk commits, the body turns to FACE where it is going and holds a short beat
     before the first step — "it looked at the couch, then went to the couch." It adds NO new behaviour and
     spends NO rarity budget: it reuses the CONSIDERED-MOVEMENT hold (pauseUntil/pauseLook), which both walk
     steppers already honour and which every seize path (summon / refit / await / encounter-break) already
     clears — so nothing can deadlock on it that could not already deadlock on a double-take.
     NEVER on a purposeful walk. A summon, an approval walk, a chase, or a social rendezvous must leave
     INSTANTLY: hesitation there reads as lag, not thought. The exclusions test live plan objects
     (self.social / self.chase) rather than self.goal, because most idle planners set `goal` only AFTER

     An ATTENTION ANCHOR fixes it without adding a single beat: whenever the body chooses to dwell
     somewhere (the same moment `fond` accrues — arrive()'s FOND table), it remembers that tile for a
     while. While the anchor is live, a stroll stays in THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD; when it lapses the body is
     free again and relocates. The result is "explores a corner for a bit, then moves on" instead of
     teleport-tier target picking — one place at a time, which is what having a mind looks like.

  /* ---------- IDLE ZONE (P1: cage every hero idle picker to the agent's own area) ----------
     A "zone" is the area a body may ROAM while idle, DERIVED on the fly from the room rects +
     props the world already holds (never persisted — shared/events.js/schema.js untouched). It is
     the room enclosing the body's assigned workstation/bay; a leash radius if it sits on open floor;
     null if it has no assignment (then it does not roam). The pure geometry lives in app/zones.js
     (window.Zones), unit-tested headlessly; this thin wrapper just resolves the anchor + room rects
     from `geo` for a given body. Guarded on `typeof Zones` (mirrors the PropAnchor/Conveyor guards)
     so a missing module degrades to "no zone object" rather than a hard error mid-tick.

     INVARIANT I2 (HERO PARITY) / A3 (SOLE OWNERSHIP): when one agent effectively owns the space
     (`soleOwner(body)` — no other bound bay/crew body), its zone WIDENS to the union of every room
     rect (the whole reachable floor = the exact geo.allRects set the pre-change pickers drew from),
     so EVERY previously-valid cross-room target stays in-zone and the 8 sentience passes are
     unchanged — even in a multi-room built-out solo station where the desk room is only ONE room.
     This is the real condition (sole-ownership widening), not "the desk room spans the station"
     (which only holds for a fresh single-room floor). Multi-room lane discipline (caging each body
     to its own room) is the intended NEW behavior ONLY once more than one agent shares the floor.

     anchorFor(body): the body's own workstation/bay foot tile — its STABLE home (never its transient
     px/py, so the zone doesn't drift as it walks). Hero falls back to the module `seat` (its synthetic
     desk) when it has no placed workstation prop; crew resolve purely via deskPropFor/bay (P2/P3). */

  /* ---------- SIGHTLINE: A WALL IS A WALL (2026-08-17, Andrew: "they talk to each other through walls")
     Every cross-body beat — the glance, the huddle, the border meeting — resolved "can these two see
     each other?" as PROXIMITY plus ZONE MEMBERSHIP, and a zone (zones.js) is a 14-tile Chebyshev radius
     around a desk intersected with the station's floor rects. A radius does not know about plaster: two
     bodies three tiles apart in DIFFERENT ROOMS both sit inside each other's radius and over floor, so
     they read as in sight with a wall between them. The D3 border meeting then made it structural rather
     than accidental — it walks both bodies to their own side of a shared room edge and has them converse
     across it, which on any real floor is across the wall.

     losClear is the honest test and it is the same shape worldmodel's own path-smoother uses: walk the
     tile line between the two feet; every touched tile must be REAL FLOOR (zoneGrid is null on a wall or
     on void) and every hop must satisfy geo.canStep, so a room boundary without a door — and a room
     sealed by an airlock — blocks sight exactly as it already blocks walking.

     PROPS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT OCCLUDERS. `walkable` would also fail on a couch, and a couch between two
     agents does not stop a conversation. This asks one question only: is there a wall in the way.

     They did, and movementBlockers above is exactly why it LOOKED handled: setPathTo plans around the
     other bodies' tiles, but that is a ONE-SHOT SNAPSHOT taken the instant a path is plotted. Nothing
     re-reads it while the legs run, so two bodies crossing the same corridor — or one walking onto a
     tile another has since stopped on — simply interpenetrate, and at T=12 with a ~35px sprite the two
     merge into a single smear.

     This is a SOFT separation, not a hard collision, and that is deliberate. The engine has no steering:
     a hard block would stand two bodies nose to nose in a corridor with no rule that resolves it, and it
     would fight arrive()'s snap-to-target. Instead, once every body has moved for the frame, any pair
     closer than PERSONAL_TILES is pushed apart along the line between them, each taking half — so they
     visibly squeeze PAST one another instead of through.

     What is exempt, and why:
       · a SEATED body (sitting/seated — desk chair, couch cushion, bed) is an ANCHOR. Its pose is bound
         to a prop's geometry and the cushion swap is draw-time only, so nudging it would slide the
         sprite off its own seat. It pushes; it is never pushed.
     A first cut also exempted any body on a 'social'/'gather' goal, reasoning that those beats own their
     own spacing. That was WRONG and the live probe caught it: a social beat owns the tiles it ENDS on,
     not the walk in, so two bodies converging on a huddle were exempt from separation for the entire
     approach — the exact moment they cross. The exemption is unnecessary anyway, because PERSONAL_TILES
     is UNDER one tile: every beat that stands two bodies on ADJACENT tiles (huddle, border, the
     gathering ring) is already untouched by construction. Only real overlap is ever resolved.

     Containment is a law here (test/crew-containment.test.js): a nudge that would put a body's feet on
     a tile it may not stand on is dropped, never clamped, so separation can push nobody into a wall. */

     The RECLINER pair is the first seat in the catalog drawn in PROFILE, and the couch's sit render —
     the whole prop sorted IN FRONT of the sitter, so a tall sofa back occludes the legs — hid it
     completely. A sofa is 5 tiles of low back behind a body; a recliner is 19px of chair over a 20px
     seated body, so all that reached the screen was the crown of the head above the backrest (Andrew:
     "the agents do not even sit in it ... they sit behind it").
     A profile seat inverts the sandwich instead: back + cushion UNDER the body, the near arm OVER its
     shins (PropSprites.drawSeatFront), which is what a person in a side-on armchair actually looks
     like. Two things follow from the art (propsprites F.recliner — cushion x+1..x+7, back x+8..x+13,
     near arm rows y+3..y+11) and nothing here is guessed:
       face — a chair points ONE way. The planner's guessed facing ('north' for a lone couch, or at
              whatever TV it paired with) would sit the body sideways in its own seat.
       dx   — px off tile centre toward the cushion, so the body's back rests against the crown
              instead of straddling it.
       lift — the SAME perch mechanism SEAT_LIFT gives a stool, and it is not optional here. A couch
              shows only a head, so nobody could see that a `lift` of 0 makes drawBody anchor a seated
              body by its STANDING foot pad; a profile seat shows the whole body, and every set whose
              sit master carries extra empty rows below the tucked legs (pikachu, xenomorph) then
              floated up onto the backrest. A non-zero lift is what switches drawBody to getTrackPad —
              the sit frame's OWN bottom padding — so all 36 skins land on the cushion. 2px, the
              chair's value, because the cushion sits barely above the near arm's crown. */

     couch and TV I placed." He was right, and it is a gating bug, not a missing feature. planProp
     — the ONLY route to a couch, an arcade, a pinball table, the bar — hung off the REST drive
     (`top === wRest`), i.e. an agent only ever went near the entertainment when it was TIRED. A
     BORED agent (the stim drive, which is what idle downtime actually accumulates) went on a
     caretaker lap, studied a machine, or paced. So a station kitted out as a games room was
     furniture the agent walked past.

     planPlay is the missing pull: when there is something FUN in reach, being bored is a reason to
     go and play with it. It is deliberately a thin wrapper over the existing planProp/tryLounge
     machinery (no new movement, no new goals, no new state) — the only new thing is that leisure is
     now reachable from the drive that actually fires. FUN_KINDS is what "entertainment" means: the

  /* ================= TIER D · D3 — SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS (Tier C grows legs) =================
     Bounded movement beats between idle bodies. The four kinds, in SELECTION order (the first that
     assembles a legal plan wins the single slot, so this order is a priority — see maybeSocial/W5b):
       'huddle'  — TWO OR THREE same-zone bodies converge on adjacent tiles, face one another, take
                   turns talking, hold, break. The conversation. (W5: the third body is optional and
                   is only recruited when a legal third tile exists — see planHuddle.)
       'border'  — two ADJACENT-zone bodies each walk to the nearest tile of their shared edge (each INSIDE its
                   own zone), face each other across the line, talk, hold, break.
       'watch'   — SILENT. An idle body stands ~2 tiles behind a WORKING body in its own zone, faces the desk, holds.
       'follow'  — SILENT. An idle body notices a walking body passing nearby, half-follows 2-4 tiles (zone-clamped),
                   then loses interest and STOPS. It NEVER completes the follow — the incompleteness is the design.
     The two SILENT kinds are deliberately last and draw a SHORTER lane cooldown than the talking
     ones: they are what happens when there is nobody available to actually talk to (W5a).
     INVARIANTS (each is a named review hunt): containment (every target zone-clamped, G3/K1); work seizes
     instantly (any participant summoned → abandons; the survivor releases within the hard timeout, G2/K3);
     one live encounter (the `socialBeat` slot + hard `until`, G4); no deadlock/cascade (idle-cadence selection off
     neighborsOf, per-pair cooldowns, a beat never spawns another, K4); station rarity (consult crewBeatDamp + arm
     via armBeat, G5); Tier B self-discipline (startEncounter is the ONE cross-body write; stepSocial mutates only
     self, K2); chat-stare exclusion (a chatFocus body never joins). */
  const SOCIAL_SEL_ROLL = 0.25;             // per idle re-decide, when a candidate pair exists + the social LANE is open (the lane cooldown — not this roll — sets the rate; this only sets how fast an OPEN lane gets consumed)
  /* W4 (2026-08-08): the lane was 5-8 MINUTES station-wide, one encounter at a time — which is why
     nobody had ever actually watched two agents meet: on a floor you look at for a few minutes, the
     expected number of encounters was under one. The beat is also no longer a silent stand-off (it
     now carries a greeting, a turn-taking exchange and a parting wave), so it is worth seeing.

     W5 (2026-08-14, Andrew: "it seems to very very rarely happen"). W4 halved the wait and it was
     still rare, because the LANE NUMBER was never the whole story — four independent governors
     multiply, and three of them were invisible in the tuning:

       (a) the lane is shared with the beats that DON'T talk. A 'watch' or a 'follow' fires
           armSocialBudget too, so a body idly tailing a walker burned the entire 90-150s
           conversation budget on a beat with no conversation in it. Split: a talking beat draws the
           CONVERSATION lane, a quiet one draws a much shorter QUIET lane (see armSocialBudget).
       (b) the kinds were TRIED in the order watch → huddle → follow → border, so whenever a
           neighbour happened to be working, the non-talking 'watch' won the race and (a) then shut
           the lane. The talking kinds are now tried FIRST (see maybeSocial).
       (c) SOCIAL_NEAR_RADIUS 5 is small against a real station: two agents at their own desks are
           usually further apart than five tiles, so the candidate set was empty on most re-decides
           and the roll was never even reached. 8 still means "in the same part of the room".
       (d) the hold was 3-7s. Even when it all lined up, the conversation was over before you looked
           at it. 9-20s is long enough to notice, watch, and record.

     What is NOT relaxed: the single live slot (G4), containment (G3), work-seizes-instantly (G2/K3),
     the shared calm budget (armBeat/G5) and the hard timeout. Still one thing at a time. */

     A meeting between two agents used to be two sprites standing a tile apart, silent, motionless,
     for three to seven seconds. Read cold it is indistinguishable from two stuck pathfinds. Both
     halves of the fix are art the sets ALREADY ship and the engine already knew how to draw:

       TALKING — `b.speaking` swaps to the set's `talk` track (5 of 38 sets) or, on every other set,
       to a livelier bob + a 1px head bounce. That is enough to read as "these two are talking"
       without a single line of dialogue — which is the right register anyway: this station's beats
       are silent by design (curiositySay has been a no-op since the Thronglet pass), and the COMMS
       transcript is where words belong. TURN-TAKING is what sells it: the two must not flap in
       unison, so each derives its turn from the encounter's OWN start clock (socialBeat.startedAt,
       stamped once by the coordinator) and its own side of the pair (a === first speaker). Reading
       a shared READ-ONLY origin, not writing shared turn state, is what keeps K2 intact.

     (A greeting/parting WAVE was built here too and then removed — the only gesture art in the
     project is an arms-up stretch, and a stretch is not a wave. See the emote() note above.)

  /* armSocialBudget — the two station-level side-effects EVERY fired encounter must do, at ALL fire sites
     (startEncounter for huddle/border, and the one-sided planWatch/planFollow which set the slot inline):
     (1) armBeat — count it against the SHARED station calm budget so quirks stay quiet in its shadow (total
     station beat rate is preserved — G5), and (2) draw the dedicated social LANE cooldown so the encounter
     RATE is governed here, decoupled from the quirk-gate race. Kept as one helper so a new social beat can
     never forget one half (a lane-arm-without-armBeat would grow the total rate; the reverse would let
     social loop).

     talk. On any floor where somebody is working, the silent kinds fire first and often, so the

     Andrew's ask: "users will notice some agents around specific other agents frequently."
     The pull is real or it is nothing — every bond here is DERIVED by the sidecar from the durable
     run log (GET /api/agents/affinity: a shared run tree, or runs reached for in the same stretch
     of work) and never assigned here. So when the station reads as "those two are always together",
     that is a true statement about how the Commander works, not decoration. An agent pair the log
     can't vouch for has strength 0 and gets exactly the old uniform treatment.

     THE BIAS MUST NOT BECOME A LOCK. Two things keep the station from collapsing into fixed duos:
       (a) weight is 1 + BOND_PULL*strength, so a stranger's weight is never zero — every pair stays
           possible, best buds are just likelier. Variety is the feature; favouritism is the accent.
       (b) the per-pair cooldown still applies (shortened, floored), so even a top bond cannot loop.
     Both matter: without (a) the floor turns into disjoint cliques, and without (b) one pair would
     eat the station's whole conversation budget and the other agents would look dead. */

     the one property that decides whether this reads as a conversation.

       elapsed  ms since the ENCOUNTER started (every participant reads the SAME clock)
       idx / n  this body's seat in the roster, and how many seats there are. The seat is the ONLY
                thing that distinguishes one participant from another — no shared mutable turn

       slotMs   one turn + the silence after it · speakMs how much of the turn is mouth-moving
     Round-robin on the slot index means exactly one seat holds the floor at a time for ANY n, which
     is the property that scales: with three bodies the risk is not silence, it is a crowd all
     mouthing at once, and `% n` makes that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.

     myTurn is the n=2 case (idx 0 = the pair's FIRST speaker, socialBeat.aId) kept as a named
     function: it is the shape test/talk-turn.test.js sweeps, and a pair must stay byte-identical

  /* ---------- W6: THE STATION HAS ITS OWN TONGUE (2026-08-16) ----------
     Two sprites mouthing at each other only read as "a conversation" if you already know the
     rule. Andrew asked for the missing half — a speech bubble over whoever holds the floor,
     carrying "language that can't be transcripted".

     THE UNREADABILITY IS THE HONEST PART, NOT A GAG. A social beat is ambient station LIFE, not
     a harness event: no message crossed the bus, no run happened, nothing was actually said. A
     bubble of English would therefore be the app asserting content it cannot prove — the exact
     class of lie this project bans everywhere else. A script that is not a language asserts
     only what IS true: these two are talking to each other, right now. WORDS live in COMMS.

     So the glyphs are not text and never can be: no font, no codepoint, no string anywhere on
     the path. A rune is a list of strokes on a 4x6 lattice, painted as pixel rects. It cannot
     be copied, pasted, translated or screen-read, because there is nothing there to copy. (Two
     more reasons it has to be geometry and not characters: VT323 ships no symbol glyphs, so any
     exotic codepoint silently falls back to a different font at a different advance — see the
     icon-vocabulary measurements — and drawn rects stay pixel-crisp at every zoom, which a
     scaled glyph font does not.)

     DIALECT: the rune subset a body draws from is seeded off its own id, so one agent's speech
     looks consistently unlike another's and a trio reads as three speakers rather than one
     noise source. */

  /* WHEN A TURN'S BUBBLE MUST BE GONE — derived from the TURN, never from when the speaker
     happened to start.

     THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL (found by running the live probe five times, not once; the fifth
     run showed two bubbles up together). A bubble used to live a fixed 1410ms from its own stamp.
     That is correct only for a body that starts speaking exactly on its slot boundary. A body
     that ARRIVES LATE joins its turn already in progress — myTurnN puts it straight on the floor
     mid-slot — so its bubble was still fading 500ms into the NEXT speaker's turn, and two mouths
     appeared to be talking at once. Exactly the shape of the W5 hold-clock defect one section
     up: a per-body clock where the encounter's own clock was the truth.

     So the window is anchored to the SLOT: whichever body holds turn k, its bubble is gone at
     k*slot + speak + fade — the instant the mouth stops, plus the fade. Late joiners get a
     shorter bubble, which is right: their turn really is nearly over. Two consecutive windows
     cannot overlap as long as speak + fade <= slot, which is a property of the tuning and is
     locked as such in test/glyph-speech.test.js. */

  /* Roll THIS turn's line — once, on the rising edge of the body's turn, never in the draw path.
     Refuses any body that is not actually in a two-sided conversation: a 'watch'/'follow' beat is
     silent by construction and a bubble over one would claim a talk that isn't happening.

     ⛔ THE SEED IS THE TURN'S ABSOLUTE INSTANT, NOT ITS INDEX. `w.turn` counts from the start of
     the ENCOUNTER, so it resets to 0 every time — seeding on (id, turn) made every agent replay
     the identical script in every conversation it ever had: same opening line, same second line,
     for the life of the station. `w.until` is an absolute clock deadline, so it identifies THIS
     turn of THIS encounter and nothing else, which is what makes a fresh conversation a fresh
     one. It is still fully deterministic — same encounter, same turn, same line — so the phrase
     holds still for as long as it is on screen, which is the property that matters for the draw.

     What deliberately does NOT vary is the speaker's DIALECT (dialectFor): an agent keeps its own
     9 runes for life, so it sounds like itself and a trio reads as three voices rather than one
     noise source. Varying that too would make the whole floor read as static. */

     seconds apart, and the loser still got most of the exchange) but is a real defect with three:
     the live probe caught a run where the third body was still walking when the first one's timer

     ended in its face. Stamping the latest arrival on the SLOT and measuring from there means a late
     arrival extends the conversation rather than being cut out of it.

     Bounded on both sides, so this cannot hang: it can only ever push the end LATER, and
     SOCIAL_HARD_MS still ends everything regardless (stepSocialGuard). A body that never arrives at
     all never stamps, so the ones who did arrive still finish on time — the encounter is not held
     hostage by a body that cannot reach it. Writing this one monotonic timestamp on the station slot

  /* ================= TIER E · THE GATHERING — the station assembles, and pretends it didn't ==========

     THE ASK, verbatim: "every so often if the station is quiet, they will all be gathered into an
     area big group, and then the overseer who is by himself, looking at the agents, and talking in
     his language... they all scatter like cockroaches when the user comes back, and they pretend
     like everything's normal. That's the whole idea." Reference: the security guard in Planet of the
     Apes noticing the apes gathered around their leader.

     WHY THIS IS ITS OWN BEAT AND NOT A BIG HUDDLE. The D3 social system is built on one encounter
     slot and a HARD ceiling of three bodies, because four sprites cannot hold a legible conversation
     (see SOCIAL_MAX_PARTY). This is not a conversation: nobody converses, one body speaks and the
     rest are an audience. That removes turn-taking entirely — which is exactly why the ceiling does
     not apply and why this is cheap to stage. It is a formation plus one speaker.

     ⛔⛔⛔ THE ROAM LEASH IS SUSPENDED HERE, DELIBERATELY, AND NOWHERE ELSE.
     Every body is normally caged to Zones.ROAM_RADIUS (14 tiles) around its OWN desk, and every
     social target is zone-clamped (G3). A station-wide assembly is by definition bodies leaving
     their own areas, so the gathering resolves its tiles against `geo.walkable` + the containment
     backstop ONLY. That is the one rule this beat breaks, it is bounded to the beat's lifetime, and
     every body is restored to ordinary leashed idle life on dissolve. Do not "fix" this by
     re-adding tileInZone: on a real floor no single tile is inside every body's leash, so the
     gathering would silently never assemble — which is the failure mode that looks like nothing.

     ⛔⛔ THE INTERRUPT IS THE PRIMARY EXIT, NOT THE EDGE CASE. The trigger requires ~30 minutes of
     quiet, which means it fires precisely when nobody is driving. So the overwhelmingly likely way
     any gathering ends is the Commander coming back and moving the mouse. Scatter is therefore the
     path that gets the care, not the timer.

     TRUTHFUL TELEMETRY. The station never acknowledges this: no COMMS beat, no toast, no event, no
     log line, nothing persisted. That is not an omission to fix later — a gathering the harness
     could prove would stop being unsettling, and asserting the agents "held a meeting" would be
     claiming coordination that never happened. They are sprites standing in a room. */

     THE DEFECT: every ambient facing in this engine was `U.pick(['east','west','south','north'])`
     — a blind cardinal. In a walled station with no windows, roughly half of those point the body
     at bare wall a tile from its nose, and the "eerie contemplation" beats (gaze-out at the room
     EDGE facing OUTWARD, face-a-wall, the vigil) pointed at wall BY CONSTRUCTION. Andrew's read
     was the correct one: it isn't contemplative, it's a character with nothing to look at.

     THE RULE: a body may hold any pose it likes, but it must be looking AT something. lookDirFrom
     ray-marches each cardinal from a stand tile and scores what the line of sight actually
     contains — depth of open floor, a prop the ray runs into, a conveyor belt, another body, a
     doorway through to the next room. A direction whose very first tile is wall scores ~zero and
     effectively never wins. The winner is drawn WEIGHTED-random from the scores, so the choice
     stays unpredictable (the engine's whole character) while never being blind.

     Pure-ish: reads geo + bodies, mutates nothing, draws one U.rnd. Degrades to the old blind pick
     when geo is missing, so a boot-order gap can never freeze a body's head. */

     cushion (occupiedSeats), so two bodies never stack on one bed and the claim is released by the same
     releaseSeat() paths. Returns false when there is no reachable in-zone bed, which is what keeps the
     standing fallback intact.

     SEAT LAW / THE BED EXCEPTION (2026-08-10, Commander's call): the body now goes IN the bed. This is
     NOT the sit pose the seat law bans — a bolt-upright chair pose parked on a mattress was the exact
     bug that law was written against. It is a third pose (`lying`): the body renders on the mattress
     clipped to the bed's top plane, and the QUILT is painted over it (PropSprites.drawOver), so all you
     see is a head on the pillow and the swell of a body under the covers. The claim, the walk and the
     one-sleeper-per-bed rule are unchanged; only the pose and the dwell are. */

     from its feet, and skins differ in height by several pixels, so a fixed foot offset lands short
     bodies with their faces in the quilt. `visTopPy` is the top of the sprite as it was ACTUALLY drawn
     last frame (drawAgent records it); the first frame after lying down uses the 15px fallback body's
