/* SPACESTATION — stationbake.js : the GENERALIZED station bake.

   v7's world.js / render.js bake the gorgeous procedural station art (floors, tilted
   walls, rounded-corner hull arcs, lit pools, hull extrusion, lightmap) — but each was
   wired to a single hardcoded room (world.js) or the fixed v7 MAP (render.js). This module
   lifts that exact bake VOCABULARY to an ARBITRARY set of rooms + corridors, driven purely
   by the geometry object WorldModel.projectGeometry() emits.

   StationBake.bake(geo) -> { baseCv, lightCv, W, H, origin, flickers }
     baseCv  — floors + walls + hull + room lighting (blit first, under entities)
     lightCv — baked darkness with light pools carved out (blit last, over entities)
     flickers — lamp positions for the per-frame shimmer (drawGlows)

   Depends only on the global `U` (util.js: U.hash, U.shade) and the DOM canvas API. */

     room's FLOOR hue, so a station is varied the moment it's built). The HULL tones went per-room

     was still painting from constants (2026-08-06). Nothing outside a room is global now.

     TONE SEPARATION IS THE WHOLE JOB. A wall face at only -0.15 off the deck's own base reads as

                wider band is a slab of wall sticking out past the station's own silhouette. It
                did not show while the band was near-black, and it showed the instant the band

                each footprint plus exactly `pad`, so a crown wider than that hangs OUTSIDE the
                mask and renders at its raw baked tone against the starfield — a blazing line

Height is the only cue a top-down view has for "interior"; the ratio of visible WALL to visible FLOOR is what sells it, and that ratio scales with `up`. 22 is inside the range 'Towering' (32) already exercised, and corUp rises with it so the hallway↔hall difference is preserved

     WHY THE CROWN NEEDS ITS OWN CUT AT ALL. The hull SKIRT hangs in void and is deliberately left
     OUTSIDE the ambient plate, so it renders at its raw baked tones — its top lip `#3f3a2c` reads
     luma 58 flat. The wall's crown is interior and takes the full 0.77 ambient, which at the dark
     end of a room drops it to 38. So the station's hull was BRIGHTER than the lit top surface of
     the wall inside it, and the corners nearest the skirt were where that inversion showed worst.
     Brightening the baked tone cannot fix it: through 0.77 ambient even a pure white crown tops out
     near luma 62, barely at the skirt. The ambient itself has to give over the crown.
     Which is also the honest reading — a crown is the one interior surface that faces the ceiling
     lamps square-on. It is cut MULTIPLICATIVELY, so the crown still darkens away from the lamps
     like everything else; it just never falls under the shell outside it. */

                  WIDTH only, which meant a room got exactly one ROW of lamps, pinned a tile and a
                  half below its north wall. A lamp's carve reaches `rad * 1.4` ≈ 84px ≈ 7 tiles,
                  so every room deeper than ~7 tiles had its whole southern half sitting at raw
                  0.77 ambient — an unlit tray with a lit strip along the top edge, which is the
                  "the lamps emit nothing" read. Rooms are not 7 tiles deep any more, so the lamp
                  grid has to run DOWN the room as well as across it. Row 0 stays exactly where it
                  was (it is the row the wall-mounted flood hardware is drawn for); the rest are
                  spread from there to the south end at this pitch.

                  WHY 8 AND NOT 7. Both light the whole deck; the difference is whether there is a
                  TROUGH between pools at all, which is the thing that makes a floor read as MODELLED
                  BY LIGHT rather than washed. Measured on an 18x14 hab: pitch 7 lays a 3x3 grid and
                  gives peak 73 / trough 47, which is an evenly lit warehouse; pitch 8 lays 2x2 and
                  gives peak 56 / trough 31 — distinct pools with real dark between them, which is
                  the station's own idiom (cf. the 'Dark + pools' preset). It is the shallow end of
                  the distinct-pools family: 9 and 10 render IDENTICALLY on a room this size, because
                  both the row and column counts are rounded tile divisions and only step at integer
                  boundaries. What 8 is NOT is the old failure — that trough sat at 17.5 and kept
                  falling to black with no recovery; 31 is a dip between two lamps. */
  /* DULLED 2026-08-15 (Andrew: "the station is a bit too bright with the lighting… slightly dull

     warm floor pool (`floor`) and the fixture grid (`pitch`) are untouched, because those are what
     put light ON the deck — dimming them flattens the modelling instead of dimming the room.
     WHICH KNOB ACTUALLY MOVES THE PICTURE, measured on the seeded hab (npm run shoot --only ingame,
     mean luma over the deck rect): `ambient` alone is nearly inert — 0.77 → 0.84 moved the deck
     29.3 → 28.8 (-1.8%), because the room cut already takes 60% of the plate back out and what is
     left is a near-black film. The CUTS are the lever: pool/room/corridor/door at the values below
     read 26.2 (-10.7%), p95 58.1 → 52.6, with the lamp pools' shape intact. `ambient` still earns
     its bump — it deepens the troughs the cuts don't reach (p5 9.1 → 7.9), which is the contrast
     half of "duller"; 0.82 is the CRT LAB's own 'Dark + pools' value, not a new number.
     THE CROWN LAW STILL HOLDS at these values (checked, don't assume): the wall's lit top reads

  /* ============================ THE EXTERIOR SHELL (HULL SKINS) ============================
     Everything you see of a room from OUTSIDE: the plate surrounding its footprint, the texture
     over that plate, the framed rim, the rounded corner arcs, and the SKIRT — the tall face
     extruded below the station's silhouette, which is what actually reads at a glance.

     Until 2026-08-05 all five came from the five constants above, so every room of every station
     wore the identical dark riveted shell (Andrew, circling exactly those edges: "the outer walls
     are not customizable"). They are per room now. WorldModel.hullMatOfRoom/hullStyleOfRoom are the
     authority; what is here is the PAINT, plus the fallback for geometry arriving without either.

     ---- THERE IS NO "NO SKIN" CASE ANY MORE (2026-08-06) ----
     `G.hullBaseOf` may still answer null, and that means "the shell's own tone" — the hue below,
     which every room that has never been re-clad carries. It used to mean something stronger: a
     whole PARALLEL PALETTE of literal pre-axis constants, kept so that stations already built
     stayed pixel-identical. That property turned out to be the defect Andrew reported — "the
     default still has the previous default mixed in ... make sure the previous shell walls are
     100% gone". A room on the old constants is not a room wearing the STATION skin: it cannot be
     re-toned, it does not answer to the material catalog, and beside a re-clad neighbour it reads
     as a different material entirely.
     So the constants are gone and the default is now an ordinary skin: the STATION material at
     STATION_TONE. What kept the look is that STATION carries its OWN palette ramp (`pal` below,
     the hand-tuned pre-axis ladder re-expressed as ratios of whatever hue the room holds) instead
     of the shared derivation — the same freedom every material already had over its bands, veins
     and dressing. The shell you always had is now a skin you can re-colour. */

  /* ---- THE VACUUM CLAMP: why a hull hue cannot be used at face value ----
     Every other surface in this bake is painted UNDER the ambient mask, which multiplies it down by
     0.77 before you ever see it. The hull is the one surface deliberately left OUTSIDE that mask —
     the skirt hangs in void and renders at its raw baked tones. So the FLOOR_STYLES palette, whose
     hues were chosen to sit in a dark substrate band *once ambient has taken them down*, renders
     roughly four times brighter out there than the same hue does inside the room.

     Measured on the shipped bake, down the middle of a south wall: the station's own shell tops out
     at luma 37, TIMBER at 51, STONE at 55, BRICK at 58 — and brick's mortar spiked to 86, brighter
     than the lit wall crown (79) and the brightest thing on the whole exterior. That is exactly the
     "doesn't look right, needs to be more cohesive" read (Andrew, 2026-08-05): a building glowing
     harder than the station it is bolted to.

     So a chosen hue is clamped into the shell's own value band before anything derives from it.
     Scaling all three channels by one factor preserves the hue exactly — it is a pure exposure
     change, which is the honest model for "this surface gets no light". The floor lifts near-black
     hues (ONYX) so a shell never goes pure void, and the cap is what keeps BONE from painting a
     blazing white building — the same standing law that killed light mode three times. */
  const HULL_LUMA_CAP = 28, HULL_LUMA_FLOOR = 13;
  /* ...EXCEPT AT THE BRIGHT POLE. The clamp above exists to stop a hue picked as a FLOOR SUBSTRATE
     from accidentally glowing when it is used on the one surface ambient never touches. But BONE and
     WHITE are not accidents — they are the palette's deliberate bright end, and nobody lands on them
     by mistake. Flattening them to 28 alongside RUST and COBALT does not make the station cohesive,
     it just makes the palette lie: you pick WHITE and get another dark grey wall.
     So a hue that is already unambiguously bright (luma over the pole) clamps to its own, much
     higher ceiling instead. A white building then really is the brightest thing outside — above the
     lit wall crown at 79, below the ceiling lamps at 127 — which is exactly what a whitewashed wall
     looks like at night, and it stays strictly OPT-IN: you have to go and choose it. */

         n = 1    a straight 45° CHAMFER — a cut corner.
         n > 2    squarer, tending to a right angle as n → ∞.

     Why it became a knob. Every void-exposed room corner got the same 1-tile fillet, on all four
     corners, at one radius — and a rectangle whose four corners are identical arcs is the silhouette
     of a bathtub or a phone screen, not of something fabricated and bolted together. A chamfer is
     the shape a real panelled hull takes at a corner, and it costs nothing extra to raster: the
     crossing walk is already row-by-row, so only the CROSSING FUNCTION changes and every concentric
     layer keyed off it — hull silhouette erase, hull rim, ambient-mask cut, interior wall curve —
     follows automatically and stays concentric per-pixel.

     n === 2 keeps the ORIGINAL expression verbatim rather than the general form, so the shipped
     look is bit-identical and not merely algebraically equal (the general form differs in the last

  /* ---------- A THRESHOLD IS A HOLE IN A WALL ----------
     Andrew 2026-08-05, drawing a red line down two abutting rooms AND across a hallway mouth: "when
     you place multiple rooms, or a hallway, the floors do appear to not blend properly. there is
     always a border that shows."

     That border is a contract drift, not a taste problem. `bakeThreshold` paints a recessed metal
     track plus a lit lip across every edge flagged `door` — correct for a DOORWAY, and written when
     a door was a hand-placed opening in a wall. The foundation then made doors AUTOMATIC: worldmodel
     opens a threshold at EVERY orthogonally adjacent tile pair of two different zones, so `door`
     quietly came to mean "the whole shared boundary". Two HAB rooms pushed together — same kind,
     same hue, same deck material, one continuous room to the eye — got a 4px bar of #3a352c painted
     down the entire join, measured at 98 luma against a 48-luma deck. Twice the brightness of the
     floor it divides. That bar IS the border he circled, and the deck's pale door guide ticks ran
     the same full length underneath it for the same reason.

     The distinction the bake was missing is architectural: a doorway is a GAP IN A WALL. If the
     seam LINE an opening sits on carries wall on BOTH sides of the gap, you are looking through a
     doorway and the sill belongs there (a 3-tile hallway mouth punched through a room's south wall
     keeps its threshold exactly as before). If the line simply runs out at both ends — nothing but
     void past the opening — there is no wall for it to be a hole in, and the two decks are one
     floor: paint nothing and let them meet.

     Classified once per bake straight off the zone grid, keyed on world tile coords so a chunked
     bake and a monolithic bake can never disagree. */
  // 0 = the seam line has run out here (void/void, or the same zone on both sides — no seam at all)

     border straight back (Andrew, 2026-08-05, red circle round the seam in his own station: "this
     does not look blended in the slightest"). His geometry is why:

         r1  HAB       x0..17, y0..10
         r8  CORRIDOR  x3..4,  y11..18
         r9  HAB       x5..16, y11..18

     The seam under r1 is one contiguous OPEN run x3..16 — the corridor and the room below are
     side by side, so nothing breaks it — and it happens to be capped by 3 tiles of wall at x0..2
     and 1 tile at x17. Both ends walled, so the cap test alone called a FOURTEEN-tile opening a
     doorway and dressed every tile of it. That is a room's whole face, not a door.

     The missing half is scale, and it needs no magic number: an opening is a doorway when it is
     SHORTER THAN THE WALL IT INTERRUPTS. 14 tiles of gap against 4 of wall is not a hole in a wall,
     it is two rooms that meet. 3 tiles of hallway mouth against 10 of a room's south wall is.

  /* ---- and a sill only belongs where the FLOOR CHANGES (Andrew 2026-08-10) ----
     Three red circles on his own station, all on threshold dressing: two real corridor mouths and a
     5-tile room|room join the minority rule had called a doorway (5 tiles of opening against a
     6-tile jamb — walled both ends, "shorter than the wall", dressed end to end). Every floor in
     that station is the same walnut plank, so to the eye there is ONE deck and every mark on it is
     a separation line. The architectural test (a doorway is a hole in a wall) answers where an
     opening IS; it cannot answer whether the floor through it needs a threshold. That is a property
     of the two DECKS: a transition strip belongs where the surface changes — walnut meeting sterile
     tile — and is exactly the line Andrew keeps circling when the same deck continues through.
     So all four dressing passes (track+lip, guide ticks, sheen dab, door light cut) now also skip
     any doorway whose two sides bake the identical deck — same material, same base colour at the
     facing tiles (floorPaint overrides included). Different decks keep their sill: the material
     change already draws a boundary there, and the threshold explains it. */

  /* ---------- floor passes (per-tile base colour → paint tool just works) ----------

     V2 FLOOR MATERIALS. The deck is the biggest surface on screen, so it carries a real
     material vocabulary instead of the old uniform 1-tile grid. The two axes are separate
     by contract: room KIND picks the material RECIPE, the per-tile base colour (floor style
     + deck paint overrides) stays the HUE — every mark below derives from THIS tile's own
     base via U.shade, so a painted tile renders its material in its painted colour. All
     marks are keyed on world tile coords (chunk↔monolithic parity) and painted as opaque
     hard-stepped pixels (the station idiom; headless-mock safe). Recipes:
       plate (HAB/default)     — 2×2 deck plates: shared per-plate tone, dark seam + catch-
                                 light, corner rivets, brushed hairline grain.
       panel (BRIDGE)          — long 4×1 panel strips with longitudinal grain, no rivets:
                                 a finished command-deck read.
       tile  (LAB)             — clean 2×2 gloss checker on dark grout, sparse specular
                                 ticks, no grime/stains.
       tread (FOUNDRY/STORAGE) — heavy plate + stamped tread ticks, weld lines, rivets.
       soft  (QUARTERS)        — wide 3×2 low-contrast plates with warm matted lifts.
     Every room also gets a PERIMETER TRIM COURSE (a darker border course where floor meets
     wall, catch-lit on its room-facing edge) and pale guide ticks across door thresholds.
     DEPTH.floorDetail scales every delta the material draws; DEPTH.floorWear rides on top.

     V4 adds four decks that deliberately DON'T read as the old station — the material axis is
     user-chosen now (WorldModel.FLOOR_MATERIALS → REFIT ▧ SURFACE), not just a per-kind default:
       grate — open catwalk mesh: top-lit bars over a dark void, substructure glimpsed below.
       hex   — honeycomb cells on an offset lattice: advanced-tech, nothing else here is non-rectilinear.
       plank — staggered wood boards: per-board tone, grain hairlines, occasional knot.
       turf  — hydroponic growth: pure blade scatter, NO lattice at all. The absence of a grid
               is the whole point; it is what separates a grown surface from a built one.

     V5 replaces `plate` as the HAB default with `spine` (see the note above deckSpine). `plate` is
     NOT deleted — it stays in the palette as the classic, so a station that preferred the old deck
     can still choose it, and no existing station loses a look it was built with. Every room carries
     `floorMat: null` (inherit), so the swap reaches stations built before it existed — which is the
     point: the default deck is the one surface every player sees and it had aged. */

     being green and turns silver. That is why capping the lift only made the lawn duller instead of
     greener (Andrew 2026-07-25: "grass is too white, I want Terraria grass").

       grass: with no correlation between neighbours, no pixel belongs to the pixel beside it, so the
       eye finds noise where it wants tufts. Real grass is CLUMPED — a patch of blades catches the
       light together, and the gaps between patches fall into shadow together.
       So tone is no longer random per blade. It comes from a two-octave value FIELD sampled on
       ABSOLUTE bake-pixel coords: a coarse octave (~8px) that mottles the lawn at tuft scale, and a
       mid octave (~3px) that breaks each tuft into strands. Neighbouring pixels sample almost the
       same field value, so they share a tone and read as one clump — and because the field is keyed
       on absolute coords rather than position-in-tile, tufts continue straight across tile borders

  /* ---------- SPINE · the deck that replaces `plate` as the hab default (2026-07-25) ----------
     `plate` was a uniform 24px grid of identical slabs with random specks dropped on it. Two things
     dated it: EVERY MODULE WAS THE SAME SIZE, which reads as bathroom tile rather than engineering,
     and its detail was scattered at random instead of composed — a hatch means nothing when it
     could be anywhere. SPINE fixes both: big STAGGERED 4×3 plates (so no module lines up with its
     neighbour above), each read as a discrete bolted panel — recess inside the joint, four corner
     fixings, brushed grain — under a heavier TRANSVERSE structural seam every third band. That
     seam is the hierarchy: one strong line, then joints, then surface grain.

     NO LONGITUDINAL SERVICE CHANNEL. The first cut ran a recessed trench (dark inner wall, lit lip,
     grating ticks) every 6 tiles, and it was the design's centrepiece — it gave the deck direction.
     Andrew cut it on sight: at station scale a room shows only two or three of them, so they don't
     read as a rhythm, they read as two black bars ruled across the floor. Do not reintroduce a
     full-height vertical line here without looking at a whole room first — the trench looked
     correct in every close-up and wrong in every wide shot, which is the trap this deck sets. */

  /* ---------- THE CORRIDOR DECK CANDIDATES (2026-07-28) ----------
     Andrew, after the hallway deck was moved onto the room material: "it doesnt really look good in
     my opinion, make a new tile set for the hallway to better match". A hallway sharing the rooms'
     deck exactly is correct about CONTINUITY and wrong about CHARACTER — spine's 4×3 panels are
     sized for a room's span, and in a 3-tile passage you only ever see a sliver of one.

     All three are AXIS-NEUTRAL on purpose. A corridor can run either way, `paintDeck` is not told
     which, and the REFIT palette samples the same function for its chip — a recipe that assumed
     "along the walk" would be wrong half the time in game and always wrong in the swatch. Direction
     is not the job of the deck here; it was tried as a full-length channel and deleted twice
     (SPINE's service trench, then the old corridor's gutters).
     Each one carries ONE idea, per the wall lane's finding that a second element competes with the
     first rather than supporting it. */

  /* RUNNER — spine's own vocabulary at a corridor's scale: bolted panels, brushed grain, four
     corner fixings, and the heavier transverse seam. The only change is PITCH, 4×3 → 2×2, because
     plate size follows span — a narrow passage is decked in narrower plates, which is true of real
     structures and is why this reads as the same station rather than a different one. The most
     conservative of the three: it matches by speaking the identical language. */

  /* THE ONE DECK PAINTER — every walkable tile in the station, room or corridor, comes through

     PRE-V2 painter that hand-rolled a slab-tread look and never called `matOf`/`paintDeck` at all.
     So a corridor's declared material was DEAD ART: `ROOM_KINDS.corridor.mat` is 'spine', set to
     match `hab` precisely so "a corridor doesn't read as a different floor through the doorway"
     (worldmodel.js), and the bake threw it away — spine, plate, grate, turf and plank all baked
     byte-identical corridor pixels. That is the whole of Andrew's "the hallway floor seems very
     outdated": it was not a dated recipe, it was NO recipe, frozen before the material axis existed.
     A user could even paint a hallway from REFIT and watch nothing happen, which is the truthful-

  /* ---------- BASE-WALL CANDIDATES (2026-07-25) ----------
     `plating` is dated in exactly the ways `plate` was, plus one of its own:
       1. ONE SEAM PER TILE. A 24px cell repeated the length of the room, every cell the same
          width — the wall reads as bathroom tile, not as a built bulkhead.
       2. FEATURES PLACED AT RANDOM. The rivet, the vent panel and the conduit drop are all
          `n % k` on the tile hash, so they land wherever and mean nothing.
       3. NO DEPTH. Every mark is painted ON one flat plane. Nothing is in front of anything
          else, so a 23px-tall face has no structure to read — one rail carries the whole wall.
     The fixes are the deck's: rhythm at a WIDER interval than the tile, features on a LOGIC, and
     a hierarchy — structure first, then panel, then rail, then grain. All three keep the crown,
     the foot and the contact seam untouched (a recipe owns the face only) and scale by wallDetail.

     Vertical budget is tight: h = WALL.up + NFACE = 23px, of which the bottom 4 are the foot
     shadow. Detail finer than ~3px does not survive the ambient bake — go coarse. */

  /* A · BULKHEAD — a raised STANCHION every 3 tiles instead of a seam every tile, with one wide
     recessed infill panel spanning the bay between them. The stanchion is the wall's structure:
     it carries the fixings (a bolt at head and foot, nowhere else), and the bumper rail BREAKS at
     it, so the rail reads as segments held between columns rather than a stripe painted over
     everything. Gives the wall the vertical rhythm the SPINE deck deliberately lacks. */

     Three versions were built and Andrew picked this one. The other two put work INTO the bay — a
     framed recess in one, two riveted courses in the other — and both lost to the empty bay. That
     is the lesson worth keeping: on a face only 23px tall with a bright crown above it and a

  /* ---------------- THE SIDE FACE — the same inner face, seen foreshortened ----------------
     Read the ladder bakeWalls documents for an e/w edge, outward from the deck:

         contact seam · INNER FACE · dark under-seam · CROWN · lit outer edge · hull

     The CROWN is the wall's top surface and is rightly plain — you do not see coursing looking down
     at a wall's cap. But the band inside it is not the crown: it is the wall's own INNER FACE, the
     identical surface `bakeTallNorthFace` hands to WALL_RECIPES, just foreshortened to `FACEW` px
     because you are looking down its length instead of square at it. It was painted as one flat
     `pal.face` fill plus a single rib line, so three of a room's four walls carried the room's HUE
     (that part was already right) but none of its MATERIAL — RIBBED, COURSES and WAINSCOT all met
     the north wall's corner as the same blank strip.

     I argued this surface should stay plain and was wrong; Andrew pushed back and the ladder above
     is why he was right. What is true is only that it cannot be the north recipe run sideways —
     4px of depth cannot hold a squashed 23px face, and squashing one produces mush. So the edge is
     AUTHORED per material instead: a depth ramp that gives the face thickness, plus the material's
     own rhythm along the wall's length. Same discipline as the hull's `dress`/`veins` split.

     COORDINATES ARE (depth, along), never (x, y) — `put` maps them per side. `d` is 0 at the wall's
     TOP edge (the crown side) and grows toward the floor contact; `a` runs along the wall's length.
     That is what lets one painter serve west, east, south and an interior north seam, each of which
     points its depth axis a different way. */
  /* ================= THE FACE STRIP — the straight wall's OWN pixels, sampled =================
     2026-08-05, Andrew on the corner: "the textures are completely different, they do not blend
     whatsoever, its literally entirely different set of graphics ... it should literally appear like
     its the wall, but just continuing on."

     He is right and the cause was architectural, not a tuning miss. The corner and the side band were
     painted from WALL_EDGES — a hand-authored vocabulary meant to RESEMBLE each recipe. An imitation
     never converges: the straight wall is `wallRibbed`'s actual tones and structure, the corner was
     my approximation of them, and two different pictures meeting at a seam is exactly what you see.

     So the curved and foreshortened surfaces no longer imitate anything. The recipe is rendered ONCE
     into an offscreen strip a few tiles wide, and every other surface SAMPLES it:
       · the straight north face  — the recipe, drawn directly (unchanged);
       · the tall corner face     — strip rows 0..len, sampled along the ARC;
       · the foreshortened side   — strip rows 0..fw, sampled along the wall.
     All three are then literally the same graphics, differing only in how much of the face's depth
     is visible and where the along-axis runs. That is what "the wall, just continuing on" means.

     ONE STRIP PER (MATERIAL, HUE, HEIGHT) — NOT PER TILE. The first cut anchored each strip on the
     tile that asked for it, so every wall edge allocated a canvas and a getImageData and the bake ran
     5-7x slower (51ms -> 291ms on an eight-room station, measured). The tile origin only decides
     WHICH tile's hash supplies the scatter detail — rivets, wear specks — while everything
     structural (ribs, courses, plate seams, rails) is T-periodic and therefore identical in every
     tile. The arc's own anchor `ax` is a tile boundary, so sampling still lands rib-aligned with the
     straight wall it joins. A fixed origin costs nothing visible and gives back the whole regression.

     `viewportRects` is saved and restored: wallViewport CUTS glass and records the hole, and a strip
     render must never inject phantom windows into the live bake (same guard sampleWall uses). */

       It was the v7 hull verbatim — a smooth six-stop ramp with one vertical seam and nothing else.
       No structure at all, which is exactly why, sat next to nine designed materials, it read as the
       empty slot rather than as the default everyone starts on.

       than double BRICK's 5 — because the thing that separates engineering from masonry at this
       scale is plate SIZE. Each strake takes a thin catch-light along its top edge, a hard shadow
       beneath where the plate above it overhangs, and a row of rivets on the lip. The rivets are the
       identity, and they are also the promise the plate ring's rim has always made and the skirt
       never kept: the hull is bolted together.

       THE PALETTE IS UNCHANGED. Only structure is added, so a hued station shell still derives
       exactly as before, AUTO is still the shell's own grey, and the ramp underneath — the thing
       that gives the station its height — is the same six stops it always was. This is the one

     ONE RING, ONE WIDTH — CORRIDORS INCLUDED (2026-07-28, Andrew on a vertical hallway between two
     rooms: "can we add walls properly to the hallways?"). This used to shrink to 0.6 for corridors
     "the same way corUp < up", and the two are NOT the same knob. `corUp` is how far a wall is
     STOOD UP, a real style choice: a lower corridor reads as a tunnel, a taller room as a hall.
     `sideCap` is how WIDE that wall's top surface is — i.e. how thick the bulkhead is — and a
     hallway's bulkhead is the same slab of station as the room's it connects. Shrinking it bought

  /* THE CORNER'S SHARE OF THE CROWN RING. On the straights the wall's lit top surface is a rect;
     around a chamfer it is the band just inside the station's own outline, and without it the ring
     broke at all four corners — which is exactly the "cuts off as if there's only a back wall"
     read, because the two TOP corners are where the eye follows the bright line and loses it.

     ---- THE OUTLINE IS ONE CIRCLE, AND A TOP CORNER LIFTS IT RIGIDLY (2026-07-27) ----
     Two rounds of this were wrong, and both failures are worth keeping because both are easy to
     walk back into.

     ROUND 1 — TWO PROFILES. The flat ring followed the hull curve while a separate column sweep
     rose 0 → WALL.up across only the DECK curve's columns, and the hull reaches `pad` further out
     than that sweep ever began. The outline stepped inward where the sweep started, then kinked
     onto a much steeper staircase. Two curves meeting at an angle is not a corner, it is a notch.

     ROUND 2 — ONE PROFILE, BUT SHEARED. Displacing the ring by a per-column EASED amount is a
     shear, and a sheared circle is not a circle: its curvature piles up where the ease is steepest.
     Andrew, tracing the arc he wanted over a screenshot: "it needs to perfectly curve at the top
     left and the top right the same way it does on the bottom." An ease cannot do that, however
     smooth the easing function is. LAW: NEVER EASE THE OUTLINE ITSELF.

     What is actually true: the wall's top surface is the footprint ring translated up-screen by the
     wall's height, and a RIGID TRANSLATION PRESERVES A CIRCLE. So the outer boundary here is the
     same radius-HR quarter circle the bottom corners use, with its centre moved up to `cy` — and
     the region it vacates is simply wall FACE, which is what standing the wall up exposes.

     `cy` is DERIVED so both ends land tangentially, which is what makes the join invisible:
       · centre y = (the straight north wall's outline top) + HR, so the arc's topmost point sits
         exactly on that line with a HORIZONTAL tangent;
       · the arc's leftmost point is then at ax - HR = X - pad, which IS the e/w wall's outer edge,
         with a VERTICAL tangent — so it leaves the side wall without a kink.
     Below that leftmost point the outline is simply the vertical run at ax - HR, which is how the
     ring crosses the chamfer tile and reaches the straight side wall underneath.

     Only the LADDER WIDTH eases (crownEase, capW → capH), never the boundary: a top surface really
     is foreshortened where you see it edge-on. Bottom corners pass cy = ay and are unchanged. */
  /* ONE SLICE OF THE CORNER'S TALL FACE — the back wall, curving.

     THE CORNER FACE IS THE SAME SURFACE AS THE STRAIGHT NORTH FACE (2026-08-05, Andrew: "it should
     look like the actual WALL on the back wall, it should look like that wall is curving"). At a top
     corner the lifted crown ring vacates a region, and that region is the north wall's own face
     coming round the bend — `bakeTallNorthFace` hands the straight version to WALL_RECIPES, while
     this one was a flat `pal.face` fill. So the back wall visibly curved and went blank doing it.

     THE MAPPING IS THE WHOLE TRICK, and it is the same one the hull's contour uses: DEPTH IS
     MEASURED INWARD FROM THE CROWN. On the straight wall that measure is height down the face; round
     the arc it is distance in from the wall's top. Under it the two families of mark transform
     correctly and automatically:
       · DOWN-wall marks (the lit top course, WAINSCOT's dado rail, SERVICE's grain) are constant
         depth — so they become CONCENTRIC bands that bend with the wall;
       · ALONG-wall marks (RIBBED's ribs, PLATING's plate seams) are constant along-position — so
         they become RADIAL SPOKES, spaced by ARC LENGTH so they neither bunch nor stretch.
     `deepRuns` are FRACTIONS of the face depth, not pixels: the face is ~23px deep at the top of the
     arc and a couple of px at its foot, and a rail pinned to an absolute depth would slide off the
     wall as it narrows. */

           different ways, so at the 45° handoff the texture flipped orientation and stepped. Andrew

  /* ---- THE POOL IS CLIPPED TO THE FLOOR, NOT TO THE ROOM (2026-08-05) ----
     Deleting every painted mark on an open seam was necessary and not sufficient. Andrew, on the
     first cut: "this does not look blended in the slightest ... i dont want to see this line in the
     middle." The second cause is LIGHT. The warm floor pool was `fillRect`ed from the room's own
     top-left corner, so the gradient — whose brightest part sits just below the fixture, ~19px down
     — got a HARD horizontal cut at the rect edge. Inside an ordinary room that cut is invisible: it
     hides under the north wall. Across an OPEN JOIN there is no wall to hide it, so the last row of
     one room (its light long since fallen off) met the first row of the next (its pool at full
     strength) with a ~30 luma step in 2px. That is a line, drawn in light instead of paint.

     Two rooms open to each other are ONE space and the light has to carry across. So the pool is
     bounded by two intersected clips instead of a rect:
       1. the station's floor union — light lands on DECK, never on void or the hull skirt (this is
          the guard the old per-rect clamp was really providing, and it does the job properly: a
          neighbour narrower than this room can no longer catch spill on its missing corners);
       2. this room's footprint, GROWN by the pool radius across whichever sides carry an open join.
     At a walled edge nothing grows and the bake is unchanged. */

  /* ---- THE LAMP GRID (2026-08-08) ----
     Two functions so the POOL pass and the FIXTURE-HARDWARE pass can never disagree about where a
     lamp is — they used to share a copy-pasted `Math.round(width / 7)` and a copy-pasted `ly`,
     which is the shape of bug that puts a mount bar where no light lands.

     `lampRows` is the new axis. Row 0 is pinned at `T * 1.6` below the room's north edge — the
     legacy single row, and the row the wall-mounted flood is drawn for, so its hardware keeps its
     light. Remaining rows spread evenly from there to `T * 1.2` short of the south edge, at the
     LIGHT.pitch spacing, so a lamp's ~7-tile carve overlaps its neighbour's instead of leaving the
     deck between them at raw ambient. A room shallower than one pitch keeps exactly one row and
     bakes identically to before. */
  /* ---- LIGHT LANDS ON A SURFACE, IT IS NOT A SURFACE (2026-08-10) ----
     Andrew, circling the lit band at the foot of a default HULL-floor room: "not a fan of how this
     lighting is on top of this black dark area — it makes it look unrealistic."

     He is describing a real modelling error, and the measurement backs him. In a room small enough
     that ONE lamp carve covers the whole deck (a 9x7 hab: room cut r≈5.6 tiles, lamp cuts r≈7.8),
     the multiplicative light map is SATURATED everywhere — set LIGHT.floor to 0 and the floor goes
     flat, which means the additive warm pool was carrying essentially all of the visible modelling
     on that deck. An additive wash is a constant: it adds the same warmth to a plate face and to
     the near-black seam beside it, so it VEILS the material instead of revealing it. Over a dark
     deck that reads exactly as reported — a warm decal floating on black.

     Real diffuse light does not add, it SCALES: reflected light is albedo × illumination, so the
     bright parts of a material gain more than its dark parts and the pattern comes UP under the
     lamp. So the pool is now painted to its own layer and its alpha modulated by the deck already
     under it before it composites. Seams stay seams, plate faces catch the light, and the pool's
     shape is unchanged — it is the same lamp, finally landing on a surface.

     `DEPTH.poolAlbedo` is the mix (0 = the old flat wash, 1 = fully albedo-scaled), live-tunable
     in the CRT LAB like every other constant here. The gain is normalised at REF so a mid deck
     bakes near its shipped strength and only the dark/bright extremes move. */

     LIGHT THE HALLWAY LIKE A ROOM (2026-07-29). Three rounds of corridor DECK work all failed for
     the same reason, and it was never the deck. With the IDENTICAL material laid in both, a room's
     floor is modelled by light across a 58-luma low-frequency spread peaking at 79, and a corridor's
     across 35 peaking at 58 — it never gets a lit area at all. `bakeRoomLighting` skips corridors
     outright, so they got no warm floor pool and no sheen; this function substituted ONE cold
     `rgba(220,230,236,0.10)` dab, half a room's alpha and the wrong colour temperature (measured
     deck warmth R-B: room 7.9, corridor 3.8).
     A floor lit by a flat wash has nothing but its pattern to show, which is exactly why a quiet
     deck (spine) read as a blank card and a busy one (meshway/treadway) read as wallpaper. The
     texture was being asked to do the light's job.
     LAW: if a surface looks wrong everywhere you put it, measure the LIGHT on it before redrawing
     it. Corridors stay DIMMER than rooms — that is the tunnel-vs-hall read and it is deliberate —
     but dim is a level, not an absence of modelling. */

         (destination-out), a second cut can only remove what ambient is LEFT, and the least is left
         exactly where a fixture already cut it: the wash added +1.1 at the fixtures and +4.4 in the
         dark middle. It was a fill light, and it flattened the wall it was meant to model.
         LAW: on a multiplicative light mask you cannot add a HIGHLIGHT, only lift a SHADOW. To make
         a surface read brighter, raise the surface's own tone or its lamp's reach — do not stack

  /* THE SKIRT — the tall exterior wall seen from outside, and the surface that carries a hull skin.
     It renders at its RAW baked tones: the ambient mask deliberately stops at the floor line, so
     whatever a recipe paints here is what you see, unlit and unmediated.

     ---- ONE SKIRT PER SKIN, NOT ONE PER STATION (2026-08-05) ----
     This was a single silhouette over every footprint at once, which is correct while the shell is
     one material: adjacent rooms merge into one unbroken wall with no seam between them, and that
     merge is exactly what made a station read as ONE building. It is also what has to give for a
     station to read as SEVERAL. Footprints are grouped by hull KEY (material + hue) and each group
     stamps its own silhouette, so same-skin neighbours still merge — the old behaviour survives
     untouched for any station wearing one skin — while a timber cabin beside a brick house each get
     their own wall and their own corner. That boundary between two skirts IS the street.

     Groups composite `destination-over` in G.allRects order, i.e. under everything already painted,
     so a neighbour's skirt can never cover a plate that is already down; between two skirts meeting
     in open void, first-drawn wins, deterministically. Grouping reads only room ids and never the
     viewport, so a chunk bake groups identically to a monolithic one (chunk-parity, the property
     stationbake.chunk.test.js exists to defend). */
  /* PER-COLUMN WALL TOP — for each canvas column, the row where this group's exterior wall begins
     (one past the silhouette's lowest opaque pixel), or -1 where the group has no wall at all.

     THIS IS WHAT MAKES A MATERIAL TURN A CORNER (2026-08-05, Andrew: "any way they can curve around
     the edges so it makes a bit more sense?"). The skirt's own DEPTH ramp already follows the hull —
     it is the silhouette stamped downward, so it curves for free, and that is why the untextured
     station shell always looked right at a rounded corner. The veins did not: they were ruled in
     flat absolute rows and then clipped by the curve, so every log course and brick bed ended at a
     different x and the corner read as a RAGGED STAIRCASE of sliced units beside a wall that curved
     perfectly. Measuring each course down from its own column's wall top instead bends the whole
     texture with the hull, and the wall runs out into the corner the way masonry actually does.

     Falls back to null where pixels can't be read back (the headless canvas mock), exactly like
     ditherLight — coursed materials then paint flat absolute rows, which is what they did before,
     so both bake paths still agree with each other and chunk parity is unaffected. */

         still needs to be at the exact angle, but just perfectly connected").

         Two rooms side by side whose south edges differ by one tile: the lower room's inner bottom
         corner is chamfered, and the erase above — correctly running over ALL chamfers — takes that
         45° bite out of the UPPER room's plate ring too. The skirt is this silhouette extruded

         else's corner to round. Restoring exactly that — each rect re-stamped minus only its OWN
         corners — extends the upper wall down to meet the chamfer at the same angle it always had.

         Built per rect on a scratch and unioned, because the erase is order-dependent: stamping

       (2026-08-06, Andrew: "if you change multiple shells it will break the whole texture system
       and start glitching out other different separate room textures ... sometimes they half
       render".)

       Each group used to be composited straight onto the base with `destination-over`, which means
       THE FIRST GROUP DRAWN WINS every pixel the others also want — and the draw order is just the
       order rooms happen to sit in `G.allRects`. Skirts overlap constantly: a footprint's plate ring
       reaches `pad` past its floor and its skirt hangs `skirt` px further, so any room within ~39px
       of another (which on a real station is most of them) contends for the same void.

       The result was a room's skirt appearing in the strip its neighbour's skirt did not happen to
       cover and stopping dead at the boundary — a HALF-RENDERED wall that looks like the material
       failed to apply, and which changes shape when ANOTHER room is re-clad, because re-cladding
       moves rooms between groups and so reorders the draw. Nothing was stale and nothing reverted;
       two materials were fighting over the same pixels and the winner was arbitrary.

       Ownership is not a draw order, it is a fact about the geometry: a skirt is the wall you see
       hanging below a footprint, so a pixel belongs to the footprint DIRECTLY ABOVE IT, and where
       two are above it, to the NEARER one. One downward scan per column settles it exactly.
       Cheap, and it makes the group masks disjoint, so composite order stops mattering at all.

       ⛔⛔ OWNERSHIP IS PER FOOTPRINT, NOT PER GROUP — AND THE VEINS PASS NEEDS IT THAT WAY.
       (2026-08-06, Andrew, with the decisive repro: "it works perfectly fine, unless u place
       something in front of the shell, then it will glitch and destroy the texture".)
       `skirtTops` answers ONE row per column: the row below the LOWEST silhouette pixel there. That
       is the whole truth only while a column holds a single footprint. Put a second room SOUTH of
       the first — "in front of" it — and both are in the same column, so the answer jumps to the
       southern room's underside and the northern room's skirt has its courses, rivets and bricks
       anchored somewhere below the room in front of it. Its BANDS still stamp (those come from the
       silhouette itself), which is why the wall keeps its shape and loses its material: it goes flat
       the instant you build in front of it, and comes back if you delete what you built.
       So the raster is keyed per RECT, and the veins pass runs once PER FOOTPRINT with that
       footprint's own skirt top, masked to the pixels it owns. Bands and the panel seam stay
       per-group: a ramp is stamped from the silhouette and a seam is a vertical line, and neither
       has anything to anchor to a column. */

  /* ---------- INTERSTITIAL SHADOW ----------
     (2026-08-11, Andrew circling two wall junctions: "the overlap of walls is terrible now. we
     need to fix this and make sure its layered correctly".)

     On a station whose footprints sit 1–2 tiles apart (every pre-snap save does), the void
     slivers BETWEEN hulls are where all the exterior dressing collides: one room's skirt hangs
     32px down, the neighbour's north face and corner arc rise to meet it, and a chamfer's
     silhouette erase bites the skirt diagonally. None of that is a draw-order bug — the nearer
     wall correctly paints over the farther one. What made the junctions read as BROKEN is the
     pixels none of them own: raw transparent void inside the sliver, where the space backdrop
     shines through a gap that the eye reads as a hole punched in the wall.

     So: any void pixel enclosed between hull silhouettes within GAP — vertically OR
     horizontally — is an alley the camera cannot see the sky through, and it fills with flat
     near-black shadow, composited UNDER everything already painted. The skirts, arcs and crowns
     then read as layered walls standing in front of a dark shaft, which is exactly what the
     geometry says they are. Open concave coastline (a run unbounded on either side, or wider
     than the window) keeps its backdrop.

     ---- AN ALLEY IS A SLIVER, NOT A CHANNEL YOU COULD HAVE WALKED DOWN (2026-08-17) ----
     ⛔⛔⛔ Andrew, circling the void between two rooms after building a hallway between them and
     deleting it: "it went black where i circled." Nothing was stale — the delete bakes
     pixel-identical to never having built the hallway (0 of 582,336 px differ, measured). This
     pass was painting the hole. `GAP` alone admitted every footprint gap from 2 to 7 floor
     tiles; `MIN_HALL` is 2, so EVERY deleted hallway landed inside the alley window and came
     back as a flat #0c0b09 slab with no stars behind it.

     The root shape this pass was built for was measured at the time and written down:
     footprints **1–2 tiles apart**. Wider than that is not exterior dressing colliding in a
     sliver, it is a genuine opening between two modules, and the backdrop belongs in it. So
     `GAP` still says which void a hull can BOUND, and `NARROW` now says which of it is close
     enough to be an alley at all. See NARROW for why the second test needs its own silhouette.

     Chunk parity: the silhouette canvas carries a margin of the full window + pad, so a
     footprint just outside a chunk's viewport still bounds runs inside it; contexts that cannot
     read pixels back (the headless canvas mock) skip the pass on BOTH bake paths, exactly like
     ditherLight. Both scans read that same margin and NARROW < GAP, so the added test is bounded
     identically and chunk↔monolithic parity is unaffected. */
