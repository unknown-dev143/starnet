/* SPACESTATION — curiosity.js : the PURE engine for JUST-IN-TIME CURIOSITY (Commander Dossier, Phase B slice 2).

   The gentle counterpart to the full intake interview: when the station notices it still doesn't know
   something about its Commander that shapes how it works, it asks about ONE thing — once, never naggy. This
   engine is the pure decision: given the dossier's still-blank dimensions, what the user has dismissed, and
   how many times we've already asked this session, pick the single dimension to ask about next (or nothing).

   Anti-nag by construction: a hard per-session cap, dimensions are asked in canonical order, and a dimension
   is never raised again once the Commander DISMISSES it OR once it has been asked-and-ignored enough times
   (stop-forever after ASK_LIMIT unanswered asks — silence reads as "leave it" so we don't loop the same
   question across sessions). PURE + node-testable (a `Curiosity` global in the browser, module.exports under
   node); the session count, the persisted dismissals, and the persisted per-dimension ask counts live in
   curiositystore.js. */

                        // task-runs in a session before it has earned the right to ask a get-to-know-you question.
                        // An unearned ask is exactly the "fake and unprompted" texture the Commander flagged.
  // HUNT MODE (ONBOARDING V3 §7): while the station is BELOW the readiness gate it may not recommend — so its
  // standing job is closing the context gap. The hunt profile makes curiosity hungrier: the work-earned floor
  // is waived (the gap IS the reason to ask — there may be no work yet to earn with) and the session budget
  // doubles. Every anti-nag protection that involves the Commander's own signal stays fully in force:
  // dismissed = never again, asked-and-ignored stops at ASK_LIMIT, and asks still ride natural moments only.

  //   blank     — dossier dimensions with no belief yet (canonical order; from Dossier.summary().blank)
  //   dismissed — map of dimension keys the user has waved off ({ stack: true, ... })
  //   asked     — map of dimension key -> times asked-and-not-answered ({ stack: 2, ... }); stop at askLimit
  //   count     — how many nudges already shown THIS session
  //   cap       — the per-session ceiling (defaults to CAP)
  //   askLimit  — the stop-forever ceiling on unanswered asks (defaults to ASK_LIMIT)
  //   work      — completed task-runs THIS session; below minWork the ask is unearned → quiet.
  //               Absent/non-finite = unknown caller (fail-open, no gate) — the live store always passes it.
  //   minWork   — the earned-ask floor (defaults to MIN_WORK)
  //   order     — OPTIONAL preferred ask order (dimension keys, best-first): the value-of-information ranking
  //               from the understanding engine, so the ONE earned question targets the dimension whose answer
  //               most sharpens the station's model of the Commander. Only re-orders — every gate (cap, earned
  //               floor, dismissed, stop-forever) applies unchanged, and a dim NOT in `order` still falls back
  //               to its canonical position after the ordered ones (never silently unaskable).
