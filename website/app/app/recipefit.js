/* SPACESTATION — recipefit.js : WHAT THIS STATION IS ACTUALLY READY TO RUN.

   The recipes tab was a MENU: 98 cards, identical for everybody, and it was on the Commander to work out
   which of them applied to their situation. That is backwards — the station already knows its own
   situation. It knows the real project folders it has been granted, which channels are connected, which
   capabilities are placed on the floor, what it has learned the Commander keeps working on, what has been
   launched before, and what is already running as a routine.

   This module turns that into OFFERS: a catalog recipe, bound to the Commander's real context, carrying
   the evidence for why it is being offered. "The Graveyard" becomes "sweep the 3 project folders you have
   granted — nothing is watching them." The catalog stops being a menu and becomes a to-do list for THIS
   station, and it re-derives itself whenever the context changes.

   ══ THE HONESTY LAW — the only rule that really matters here ══
   ⛔ AN OFFER MAY ONLY CITE WHAT THE CONTEXT ACTUALLY CONTAINS. Every `why` string is built from a counter
   that was passed in: 3 projects because ctx.projects.length === 3, "never scheduled" because no cron job
   carries that recipeId. This module NEVER guesses, never says "you probably", and never describes the
   CONTENTS of anything it was not given — it has not read inside those folders, so it may not claim there
   are four abandoned drafts in them. It may only say the folders exist and nothing is watching them. That
   distinction is the whole difference between a station that earns trust and one that makes things up,
   and it is the product's core law applied to its own recommender.

   Pure and deterministic: same ctx -> same offers, no clock, no storage, no fetch. The caller gathers the
   context (marketplace.js) and does the rendering; everything here is testable under node.

   UMD-light: a `RecipeFit` global in the browser, module.exports under node. */
