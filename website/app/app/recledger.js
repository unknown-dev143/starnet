/* SPACESTATION — recledger.js : THE SPINE'S HALF OF THE ONE RECOMMENDATION MEMORY.

   THE PROBLEM THIS CLOSES (audit, 2026-08-05). The station kept TWO recommendation memories that never spoke:

     · the DURABLE, CROSS-SURFACE LEDGER (sidecar/recommendation-ledger.js) — what was shown, why it was allowed,
       what happened next. Written by four surfaces (scout/prospect, study, suggest, autojobs) and READ by six
       propose-time filters (reflection, thread mining, quest minting, the scout, the night shift, FOR YOU) plus
       the recruiter's preference model.
     · the BROWSER QUALITY EWMA (recqualitystore.js) — how well each spine channel's accepted offers actually
       turned out. Read by exactly one consumer: the spine.

   So a Commander who declined an idea at a COMMS card had declined it in localStorage only. The night shift could
   build it while they slept; the bay could shelve it the next morning; nothing outside chat.js ever learned that
   this channel's offers keep getting waved off. And the spine — the one place that decides who speaks — could not
   see a single one of the verdicts the rest of the station had been recording for months.

   This module is the missing wire, and it is deliberately THIN: the durable ledger already exists and already has
   the right shape. Everything here is either a write INTO it or a read FROM it.

     WRITE  note(candidate)            — the offer the spine just fired becomes a `shown` row.
            verdict(channel, …)        — the Commander's answer becomes that row's terminal state.
     READ   isDeclined(text)           — did they already wave this exact thing off ANYWHERE?
            preferenceOf(kind, traits) — the ledger's own learned, bounded, decayed preference weight.

   THE LAWS IT HOLDS (each one learned the hard way somewhere else in this repo):

   1. EXACT NORMALIZED MATCH, NEVER FUZZY. normKey() is byte-for-byte the sidecar's declinedindex.js normalization,
      duplicated rather than imported because this file runs in the browser and that one does not. A FALSE
      suppression — silently dropping a legitimately different idea — is worse than an occasional duplicate.
   2. FAIL-OPEN AT EVERY STEP. No fetch, no token, a 500, a hung request: the sets stay empty, isDeclined() answers
      false, preferenceOf() answers 0, and the spine ranks exactly as it did before this module existed. A memory
      the station cannot read is never a reason to go quiet.
   3. NO ROW WITHOUT A TITLE. A candidate that cannot name what it is proposing gets no ledger row — the same
      evidence-or-silence law the spine applies to its own citations, applied to its bookkeeping.
   4. THE CHANNELS THAT ALREADY WRITE THEIR OWN ROWS ARE LEFT ALONE. study (studystore.js) and suggest
      (suggeststore.js) mint their own ids with their own lifecycles; a second row from here would double-count
      every impression and halve their measured acceptance rate. OWN_LEDGER names them, and note() refuses them.
   5. `rate` AND `memory` ARE NOT SUGGESTIONS. The run earns them — the station never chose to interrupt — which is
      the same reason recommend.js exempts both from the ask budget and recqualitystore.js records no outcomes for
      them. They are not offered to the ledger either.

   Discipline mirrors the sibling stores: injectable fetch/clock, node-exportable for its test, READ-ONLY citizen
   of the event spine (it does not subscribe at all — the caller drives it). */

     records (cheap, coalesced by REFRESH_MIN_MS) — never on a timer.

     WHY DECLINES ARE READ EVEN WHEN PERSONALIZATION IS PAUSED: a decline is not a learned preference, it is an
