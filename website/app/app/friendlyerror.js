/* SPACESTATION — friendlyerror.js : turn a raw failure into something a beginner can act on.
   Pure + testable (UMD: a `Friendly` global in the browser, module.exports under node).

   The COMMS panel used to surface raw plumbing on a failed turn — "sidecar HTTP 500", an OpenRouter
   payload, a capdenied string — and the ↻ retry chip fired blindly regardless of WHY it failed. This
   maps any error (the thrown Error from Harness.chat + an optional HTTP status) to:

     friendlyError(err, status, opts) -> { userMessage, kind, retryable, action, raw, engineAlive }

   • userMessage — one plain-language sentence to LEAD the error row with.
   • kind        — a stable class (mirrors the sidecar classifier's reasons, plus the UI-level
                   `network` / `capdenied` / `user_abort` cases the browser sees but the API layer doesn't).
   • retryable   — whether a plain "↻ Try again" makes sense.
   • action      — null | 'settings' | 'skills' | 'store' | 'refit' | 'reload': a context-aware DESTINATION
                   instead of a blind retry. capdenied's true unlock is REFIT (place the gear) —
                   NOT the SKILLS list — because a station quest, minted on the denial, completes
                   by PLACEMENT (stationqueststore.js). auth/no-key opens the PROVIDERS key field.
   • cap         — (capdenied only) the resolved capability id ('web'|'cabinet'|…) parsed from the
                   raw 'no <need> — …' message, so copy can name WHICH power was missing + its gear.
   • raw         — the original technical text, kept for a de-emphasized sub-line / title tooltip.

   RENDERING THE ACTION (the door): `actionButton(verdict)` maps a verdict to { label, run } — a
   ready-to-wire button that OPENS the exact surface (Build.open() for REFIT, the settings PROVIDERS
   section for keys, StationUI SKILLS for a skill toggle). The consumer (chat.js offerRetry) calls
   it instead of re-deriving the label/route per action, so a new action door is added in ONE place.

   INTEGRATION (not duplication): when the sidecar classifier module is reachable (node/tests), we delegate
   to classifyApiError() to derive the reason, then translate that reason into a beginner-facing message —
   so the truth table stays single-sourced. In the browser the sidecar module isn't loaded, so we fall back
   to a lightweight pattern-match over the SAME kind vocabulary on the UI-level error strings Harness throws
   ('sidecar HTTP <status>', 'cannot reach the SPACESTATION sidecar…', a forwarded 'no <cap> — …'). */

  /* IS THIS THE SIDECAR'S *OUTBOUND* CALL FAILING? (2026-07-29 — from a real user's diagnostics report.)
     The word order is the tell, and it is decisive. A BROWSER fetch rejection says "Failed to fetch" (Chromium),
     "NetworkError" or "Load failed". NODE/undici says "fetch failed" — the other order. So a raw text carrying
     `fetch failed` cannot have come from this page's fetch to the sidecar; it can only have been produced INSIDE
     the sidecar and forwarded to us, which means the hop that broke is sidecar -> MODEL PROVIDER. Same for the
     Node-only DNS/undici strings (getaddrinfo, ENOTFOUND, EAI_AGAIN, UND_ERR_*), which no browser ever emits.

     This existed as a real user report: diagnostics showed a healthy local engine (uptime, workspace present, the
     report itself was served by it) with five `fetch failed` entries — the sidecar could not reach chatgpt.com /
     api.openai.com — and the app told them "Can't reach SpaceStation's local service, restart it". They lost a day.

     WHY THE BUG SURVIVED: sidecar/providers/errorClass.js:168 ALREADY classifies undici transport codes
     correctly, but friendlyerror only `require`s it in node/tests — in the browser classifyApiError is null, so
     the real user path fell through to isTransportLoss and blamed the local service. Getting this right in the
     BROWSER fallback ladder is the whole point; a node-only test proves the half users never run. */
