/* SPACESTATION — quests.js : the PURE quest-skin engine. Dresses the station's EXISTING, honest progress as RPG
   quests — without inventing anything. It is a read PROJECTION over three real sources:
     • xp.js MILESTONES   — real achievements (tasks shipped, memories reused…); earned = a done quest.
     • the Commander dossier — each still-blank dimension is a "get to know you" quest; known = done.
     • a pending agent idea  — an ONGOING suggestion currently waiting in COMMS = one actionable quest. (The one-time
       First Pitch is NOT surfaced here: it fires the instant it's earned — it never sits "waiting" — so it has no
       quest-log state. Only the recurring SuggestStore.willSuggest cadence produces a waiting idea.)

   THE LAW (inherited from xp.js): every quest cashes out in a REAL capability or outcome — never a fake XP
   currency — and the log NEVER gates anything. It reveals the order of progress; it does not withhold. So an
   "open" quest is always something the Commander can just do now; nothing is locked behind a level.

   PURE + node-testable (a `Quests` global in the browser, module.exports under node). No Date.now / Math.random:
   the quest list is a deterministic function of the live state the store passes in. The browser wiring (the
   quest-log panel) reads DossierStore / XpStore / SuggestStore, calls build(), and renders — it owns nothing here. */

  //   milestones  — Xp.milestones(stats) → [{ id, label, hint, earned }]
  //   dossierDims — [{ key, label, known }] (the store joins Dossier.DIMS with DossierStore.summary())
  //   pendingIdea — true when an ONGOING suggestion is due (SuggestStore.willSuggest()). The First Pitch is excluded
  //                 on purpose: it fires immediately on graduation, so it's never a "waiting" log entry.
  //   ledgerQuests — (QUEST V2 §C) the sidecar-owned quest ledger (/api/quests), pre-shaped by QuestLedgerStore
  //                 as [{ id:'q:N', kind:'ledger', ledgerKind, title, desc, reward, status, contract, steps,
  //                 attest, declineNote, ... }]. Spliced right after the waiting idea. Absent input → unchanged.
  //   stationGaps — (G1b) fix-it quests projected from StationQuests: [{ id, kind:'station-gap', title, desc,
  //                 reward, status }] — an agent reached for a tool its room can't grant. Already fully shaped

  //                 them into the ordered list right after the waiting idea, so a real capability failure surfaces
  //                 as the most-actionable direction. Absent input → unchanged (older callers untouched).
  //   workQuests  — (G1c) accepted-idea builds projected from WorkQuests: [{ id, kind:'work', title, desc,
  //                 reward, status }] — a pitch/idea the Commander said "build it" to, with real step progress.
  //   maintQuests — (G1c) fix-it quests projected from MaintQuests: [{ id, kind:'maintenance', title, desc,
  //                 reward, status }] — a recurring slag cause or a jammed routine became actionable direction.
