/* SPACESTATION — recommend.js : THE RECOMMENDATION SPINE (pure, node-testable, zero DOM / zero fetch).

   The station used to talk to its Commander through ~9 independent proactive channels (study, arc, trust,
   thread, rate, suggestion, seed, routine, recruitment, curiosity), each with its own timer. Whoever armed
   EARLIEST won the one post-run beat, so the LOWEST-value ask usually spoke first and the priority order
   baked into beatcard.js was inert. This module is the single relevance bar they all pass through.

   Two laws it enforces, both of them the product's truthful-telemetry law applied to recommendations:

     1. ONE VOICE — pick() returns at most ONE candidate. Best-first, or silence.
     2. EVIDENCE OR SILENCE — a candidate with no non-empty `why` is DROPPED, never shown. The station may
        only make a proactive offer it can justify out of real state (the Commander's own words, a real
        streak count, a real targeted gap). No citable evidence means the channel stays quiet.

   A candidate is a plain object:
     { kind, why, dim?, base?, streak?, declines?, strength?, quality?, preference?, title?, target? }
       kind     — the channel id (see PRIORITY). Its beat-slot family is slotKindOf(kind).
       why      — the evidence string, derived from REAL state by the channel adapter. Required.
       dim      — optional dossier dimension this offer targets (enables the value-of-information term).
       base     — optional explicit base score override (tests / future channels).
       streak   — optional non-negative run of corroborating signal (trust's approval streak).
       declines — optional count of recent declines on this channel (a soft penalty, never a hard block;
                  the per-channel session caps/denylists remain the real floor and live in their stores).
       strength — optional 0..1 EVIDENCE STRENGTH (recquality.js): how well-grounded this candidate's citation
                  actually is — dim confidence, belief freshness, a real repeat counter. Weak evidence is
                  DISCOUNTED within its tier; it never fabricates a bonus, and an absent reading is NEUTRAL.
       quality  — optional CHANNEL QUALITY WEIGHT (recqualitystore.js): the EWMA of the outcomes this channel's
                  accepted offers really produced. Neutral 1, floored at 0.5 so quality alone can never silence
                  a channel — a dud channel gets quieter, never mute.
       preference — optional LEARNED PREFERENCE WEIGHT (−0.75..+0.75) from the durable cross-surface ledger
                  (recledger.js): the Commander's own decayed accept/decline history for this kind. The one
                  TWO-SIDED modifier here, because it is their answers rather than the station's confidence.
       title    — optional plain-language name of the thing being proposed. Not scored: it is what the ledger
                  records and what the shared declined memory is matched against. A channel that proposes an
                  IDEA should carry one; a channel that asks a question about the station need not.
       target   — optional stable key for the ledger row (defaults to a fingerprint of the title).

   SCORING IS BANDED (redesigned 2026-08-04, after the scorer was proved INERT). It used to give every KIND its
   own 100-wide tier and clamp the whole modifier sum to ±50 — which, since the pass emits at most one candidate
   per kind and pick() breaks a dead tie by rank, meant no modifier could ever change the winner. Exhaustively
   proved: 0 of 20000 random fields ranked differently from pure priority order. Strength, quality, VOI, streaks
   and declines were decoration. The structure now has two levels:

     BANDS  — memory alone, then the turn-ins [study arc trust thread], then rate, then the five gentle channels.
              Bands are BAND_STEP apart and the whole modifier budget (MOD_CAP, ±) is strictly under half the
              smallest gap between adjacent bands, so NO stack of modifiers can ever move a candidate across a
              band. That is the part of the old law worth keeping: a gentle nudge can never outrank a turn-in.
     RANK   — inside a band, kinds sit RANK_STEP apart. That step is a TIE-BIAS, not a wall: it decides who
              speaks when the station knows nothing about either channel, and the modifiers are deliberately
              large enough to overturn it. Same-band reordering is the POINT — a fresh, high-value curiosity
              question may beat a stale recruit pitch, and a dud-channel suggestion may lose to a routine nudge
              whose accepted offers really produced work. Priority is the default, not the verdict. */

     recruitment → curiosity). That order is the TIE-BIAS — what decides when the station knows nothing about
     either channel — NOT a wall: since the band restructure, evidence really does reorder same-band kinds, which
     is the point of measuring it. (This comment used to claim consolidating the ladder "changes who can speak,

         it declines to shout about one whose evidence is thin.

     neutral in effect — it is a small RELATIVE ADVANTAGE over a channel that reports one honestly and reports it

     valuable thing the station can ask about. That is deliberate and it is this module's stated law — silencing a

     station computed. Raising this until quality could veto VOI was tried and reverted. */

  /* ── THE LEARNED PREFERENCE TERM (one-memory lane, 2026-08-05) ──────────────────────────────────────────
     `preference` is the DURABLE CROSS-SURFACE LEDGER's own learned weight for this candidate's kind and traits
     (sidecar/recommendation-ledger.js replay → foldPref → the Bayesian-smoothed, half-life-decayed weight in
     −0.75..+0.75; recledger.js carries it into the browser). Until now the spine could not see it at all: the
     ledger had been recording what the Commander accepts and declines across the bay, the night shift, the
     quests and the scout for months, and the one component that decides who speaks was ranking blind to all of it.

     WHY THIS ONE IS TWO-SIDED, when strength and quality are not. Those two are the STATION's readings about its
     own confidence, and the law there is that the station never promotes an offer for feeling sure — it only
     declines to shout about a thin one. This is not the station's reading. It is a decayed tally of the
     COMMANDER'S OWN ANSWERS, and their yes deserves exactly as much weight as their no. Rejecting the positive
     half would mean a kind they have accepted eight times running is ranked identically to one they have never
     seen — which is not caution, it is deafness.

     BOUNDED, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HERE. ±0.75 of ledger weight maps onto ±PREF_MAX, which is two rank steps: it
     reorders a band comfortably and cannot come near the band wall. A cold ledger, a paused personalization
     setting (the server sends `model: null` and recledger reports 0), or a kind with no history all read exactly
     0 — the neutral contribution — so nothing changes until the Commander's real history says it should. */
