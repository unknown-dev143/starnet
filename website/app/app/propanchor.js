/* SPACESTATION — propanchor.js : where an agent STANDS or SITS to use a prop.

   The gen prop model (worldmodel.js) stores props as pure rectangles; a blocking
   prop's whole footprint is unwalkable, so an agent can never path ONTO a couch/
   arcade/TV — only to an adjacent floor tile. This module derives that approach
   tile + the facing dir, porting v7's standNearFurn (agents.js): prefer the front
   (south) edge, then the other sides; the first walkable, non-blocked tile wins.

   PURE: depends on nothing but a `geo` exposing walkable(lx,ly,extra). No DOM, no
   time, no RNG — so it is unit-tested headlessly (test/propanchor.test.js). Both
   the live world (world.js, global PropAnchor) and Node tests (require) use it. */

  /* ---- orientation: which way is this prop's FRONT? ----
     A prop carries `r` = quarter turns CLOCKWISE (worldmodel; 0 = the shipped south-facing art).
     Turning the prop turns the side an agent is meant to walk up to, so the approach order has to
     turn with it — otherwise an armchair aimed west would still be approached from the south and
     its user would stand at its flank. That is what makes rotation gameplay-real rather than a paint
     job. `m` (mirror) is deliberately ignored: a flip swaps handedness, never facing.
     One CW turn maps a side's outward normal (x,y) -> (-y,x): south(0,1)->west, west->north, etc. */

     agent should approach the MIDDLE of a desk/couch/bar and fan outward only if the middle is blocked.
