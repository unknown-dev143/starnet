/* SPACESTATION — seedreuse.js : the PURE seed-reuse AGGREGATE engine (Game session, Phase G3b / Layer 6).

   G3a's SeedCredit is per-MOMENT ("this run reused the seed you saved"). This is the AGGREGATE half of the
   meta loop: it counts how often each Commander-saved seed genuinely ran, over a rolling 7-day window AND
   over the station's lifetime, so:
     • when a seed crosses N runs in the window (N=5), the station fires ONE gentle callout — "the seed you
       saved ran 5× this week" — fire-ONCE per window (it won't re-nag until the window rolls past that crest);
     • the lifetime counts live permanently on the TROPHY CASE's "living tools" shelf (livingTools()).

   HONEST provenance only (the whole reason SeedCredit exists): a run is credited to a seed ONLY when the
   provenance genuinely links — the caller passes the already-matched seed NAME (from SeedCredit.matchSeed /
   the digest's row.seed annotation). This engine never guesses which seed a run belongs to; it only tallies
   what the matcher already proved. An unmatched run contributes nothing.

   PURE + node-testable (a `SeedReuse` global; module.exports under node). No DOM/clock/rng — the caller
   injects nowMs and the matched seed name. Ring-capped per seed so a heavy user can't grow state unbounded. */
