/* SPACESTATION — nightreport.js : the PURE engine for the MORNING REPORT (NS-4).

   THE PROMISE: Andrew must never again wonder "what did you do all night, and if nothing, why?". On the first
   activity after a real absence, the station owes ONE honest digest — the acts it fired AND the honest other half
   (what it DECLINED, and the one plain reason it did nothing at all). This module composes that digest from the
   three truthful-telemetry surfaces the night-shift already serves:

     • GET /api/nightshift/status  → { active, away, beatsUsedToday, leashPerDay, lastBeatAt, nextEligibleAt, binding }
     • GET /api/autonomy/ledger    → recent decisions (source:'nightshift', kind:'act'|'decline'|'note', binding, reason)
     • GET /api/nightshift/drafts  → the acts left on the desk ({ title, archetype, at, body, note })

   EVERY line here maps to one of those provable fields — the report never asserts state the harness can't prove
   (the product's core law). PURE + node-testable, mirroring autonomy.js / autopilot.js: a `NightReport` global in
   the browser, module.exports under node. NO Date.now / Math.random — the report is a deterministic function of the
   three payloads + an explicit `nowMs`. Time formatting takes an explicit tz-offset so LOCAL time is testable. */

    readiness: 'the station doesn’t know you well enough yet to act unattended — run a few real tasks (or answer its questions) so it learns',

    'precheck-error': 'the station could not verify its budget, provider, or readiness checks, so it stood down safely',
    'persist-failed': 'the station couldn’t safely record the work, so it stood down'
  };
