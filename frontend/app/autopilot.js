/* SPACESTATION — autopilot.js : the PURE engine for the IDLE SELF-DIRECTION DRIVER (autonomy layer, Slice A).

   This is the missing CONSUMER of the autonomy posture. Slices 1–2 shipped the dial (autonomy.js) and cron
   self-initiation (autojobs.js), but nothing read the posture to actually drive idle behaviour — so the dial had
   no effect on the floor. This engine closes that: when the Commander goes idle, it decides what the station
   should do on its own, GATED by the dial AND by how well it actually knows the Commander.

   THE DECISION (pure + deterministic; the live clock, the dossier reads, and the curiosity hand-off live in the
   thin store, autopilotstore.js):

     idle + posture →  EARN  (learn one thing — ask a gentle get-to-know-you question)
                  or   ACT   (do a small reason/draft job toward their goals)      ← Slice A2
                  or   none

   THE CONFIDENCE FLOOR (the anti-slop heart): an idle agent that confidently does the WRONG work is worse than
   one that does nothing — the first autonomous deliverable sets trust forever. So ACTING is EARNED, not just
   permitted. readiness() reads the (confirmed-only, never-inferred) dossier — breadth, the required dim, and
   recency — into a tier; decide() acts only when the dial permits AND the tier is hot; otherwise it EARNS more
   context first (the flywheel: when it doesn't know enough to act, it acts to know more).

   THE GOVERNING RULE — ceiling vs earned: the dial is the ceiling the Commander PERMITS; the tier is the level the
   station has EARNED; it operates at the LOWER of the two and names which is BINDING (legibility — "you set me
   free, but i'm still learning you, so here's a question instead of a guess"). WAIT means nothing, ever.

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring autonomy.js / autojobs.js / pitch.js: an `Autopilot` global in the browser,
   module.exports under node. NO Date.now / Math.random — a decision is a deterministic function of (posture,
   idleness, dossier-readiness). The store injects the clock. */

     the station actually knows never exists, and if nothing clears the confidence bar the station does NOTHING
     (idle-doing-nothing beats shipping slop). Only score-based selection lets a future LEARN loop re-weight per
