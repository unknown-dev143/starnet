/* SPACESTATION — toolprops.js : PURE tool-name -> capability-prop mapper (G0.1).

   The single source for "which placed prop does a firing tool light up?" — the render-side
   mirror of the sidecar's CAP_REGISTRY (sidecar/capability/registry.js), keyed the same way
   worldmodel's CAP_PROP_MAP keys prop types to capability objectTypes:

     fs.*                                        -> 'cabinet'   (files)
     web_search / web_fetch / public browser.*   -> 'dish'      (web)
     channel.*                                   -> 'dish'      (outbound comms — the dish transmits too)
     notebook.* / skill.* / recall_conversation  -> 'notebook'  (memory; todo moved to `computer` 2026-08-17)
     image_*                                     -> 'studio'    (media)
     spotify_*                                   -> 'jukebox'   (spotify)
     audio_generate                              -> 'audiolab'  (local audio lab)
     video_generate                              -> 'cinema'    (video generation)
     video_compose                               -> 'editingbay'(video assembly)
     doc_publish                                 -> 'publishinghouse' (documents)
     report_publish                              -> 'briefingroom'    (status reports)
     print_prep                                  -> 'printshop'       (print checking)
     etsy_listing_check                          -> 'listingdesk'     (listing validation)

   Everything else maps to null ON PURPOSE — those tools already have their own dedicated
   floor visual, so mapping them here would double-fire:
     mcp__<id>__*      -> the connector PORTAL pulse (world.js polls + pulseConnector)
     shell.* / verify.* / browser.test_* -> the WORKBENCH pulse (shell.exec / verify.result events)
     team.* / routine.*                -> the lead->worker handoff boxes (orchestration visuals)
     model.chat                        -> the compute gate, not a callable prop tool

   Pure + headless-safe: no DOM, no clock, no state — a name goes in, a prop type (or null)
   comes out. Loads under require() for the unit tests exactly like worldmodel.js. */
