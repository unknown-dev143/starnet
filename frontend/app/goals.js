/* SPACESTATION — goals.js : the PURE GOAL-TREE engine (GROWTH Tier 2: understanding → direction).

   Today a Commander "goal" is a flat dossier belief string ("shipping a local-first agent harness"); a quest is
   an isolated one-off; a completed quest fires SFX+toast and feeds back NOTHING. This engine upgrades a goal
   into a STRUCTURED, PERSISTED TREE — one goal decomposed into 3-5 ordered MILESTONES, the next OPEN milestone
   surfacing as an actionable quest, real chaining as milestones complete, an HONEST progress meter (done/total,
   nothing synthetic), and completion EVIDENCE written back into the node. The agent decomposes; the Commander
   confirms; only real completed work advances the bar.

   The tree shape:
     goal = { id, text, sourceBeliefId, status:'active'|'done'|'retired',
              milestones:[{ id, text, status:'open'|'done', questRef, evidence, doneAt, journeySyncedAt }],
              createdAt, updatedAt }
   - sourceBeliefId binds the goal to the dossier goals-dim belief it decomposed (dossier.js cd_N ids), so if the
     Study Engine RETIRES that belief (dossier.forget → drift), the goal tree goes status:'retired' (kept for
     history, hidden from the active quest log). retireBySource() carries that propagation.
   - progress(goal) = milestones done / total — the ONLY progress there is (a milestone is done only when its
     REAL work quest completed; foldMilestoneDone writes the evidence + advances the bar; nothing is synthetic).

   PURE + node-testable (a `Goals` global in the browser, module.exports under node), mirroring dossier.js /
   quests.js: NO Date.now / Math.random — the clock is ALWAYS injected (ids/timestamps deterministic + replay-
   safe). parseDecomposition() reads the agent's tagged reply into 3-5 milestone lines with the SAME value floor +
   cap + redaction discipline study.js applies to its belief lines. The browser wiring (goalstore.js) supplies
   Date.now() at the edge, the model call, the dossier reads, and persistence; this file owns only the deterministic
   fold + the quest projection.

   Fail-open by construction: an absent goal, an empty decomposition, a malformed reply — all yield an inert tree
   and never throw. A station with no goals.js loaded is byte-identical to before (additive-only). */
