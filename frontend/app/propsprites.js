/* STARNET — propsprites.js : the canonical PROP (furniture) art + catalog.

   v7's sprites.js drew ~85 furniture pieces as detailed PROCEDURAL pixel art — outlined
   casings, 2–3 tone shading, contact shadows, and animated emissive bits (a TV cycling
   channels, console LEDs blinking, screens that light when worked). Tiles are 12px in both
   v7 and gen, so the art ports 1:1 with no rescaling.

   This module is the single source of truth for props:
     - CATALOG  — every placeable prop: id, label, category, default tile footprint, flags
                  (animated, blocks-walk). Drives the builder palette AND the model defaults.
     - F{}      — the procedural draw functions, ported verbatim from v7 (id ↔ F key).
     - draw(f, work) — blit one prop. f = {t, x, y, w, h} in LOCAL tile coords (the bake frame),
                  exactly like world.js's existing F_desk pass. Call setCtx()/setNow() per frame.

   Props ANIMATE, so they are drawn per-frame OVER the static StationBake base and UNDER the
   lightmap (so they're lit) — never baked. Depends only on the global `U` (util.js) + a 2D ctx.
   Headless-safe: requiring the module does nothing until setCtx() is called. */

  /* ============ v13 LOCAL COLOUR — one knob over every pixel a prop paints ============
     MEASURED, not guessed (gal/shot.mjs, 29 lounge/decor props on a live seeded station): the
     catalog's MEAN AUTHORED CHROMA is 28/255, and the render pipeline (ambient plate + room cut +
     CRT scan/fade/vig) delivers only **54%** of it to the screen — mean rendered chroma 15. The
     plants are the extreme: monstera authors 44 and renders 8. That is why a room full of props
     whose source really does carry warm oak, brass, deep red and teal still reads as grey-green mud.
     Lifting the LIGHT is a real but bounded lever and it costs brightness that is already dialled
     (ambient 0.82 → 0.55 only recovers 54% → 66%), so the rest has to come from the art's own chroma.

     `CHROMA` scales the SATURATION of every colour a prop paints, holding hue and value exactly.
     Hue and value are what the silhouette and the lighting logic are built on; saturation is the one
     axis with no structural job, which is why it can be a knob at all.
     ⛔ THE TEAL TRAP IS REAL (2026-08-16): amplifying the chroma of a hue that is merely a LITTLE
     cool turns a grey casing green/teal on a warm deck. So the ceiling is hue-dependent — warm local
     colour (wood, brass, terracotta, fabric) is allowed to go saturated, cool machinery is held near
     grey. Machinery is *supposed* to be grey; the defect is a prop with no saturated element at all.
     ⛔ Already-saturated colour is LEFT ALONE (emissives, ACC leds, screen phosphor): boosting a
     colour that is already doing its job only clips it. */

  /* ============ v4 MATERIAL KIT (2026-07-24) ============
     v3 locked PROJECTION and SILHOUETTE and is NOT reopened here. v4 only fixes what v3 left flat —
     MATERIAL and LIGHT — so footprints, the oblique law, and the bolted-to-deck language all stand:
       (1) TWO-TONE LIGHT. A prop lit by one white lamp reads flat no matter how many tones its ramp
           has. Real metal takes a WARM key off the station's ceiling strips (high + west) on its lit
           edges and a COOL sky bounce on its shade edges. keyEdge/rimEdge are 1px washes that add
           that split on top of the existing ramp instead of replacing it.
       (2) FALLOFF EMISSIVES. glow() stamps one flat alpha rect, which reads as a translucent sticker.
           bloom() lays 3 nested rings so light actually falls off, and spill() runs light DOWN a
           surface from an emitter above it (a screen pooling onto a tabletop).
       (3) BOLDER SILHOUETTE. rr() cuts 1px corners — at 12px tiles that still reads as a lozenge.
           chamf() cuts k px (default 2) so a body can be genuinely chamfered, and cable() hangs a
           real sagging line, which is the cheapest way to break a boxy outline. */
  const KEY = '#ffe0b0';                         // warm key — the station's ceiling strips, west-biased
  const SKY = '#7fb4d8';                         // cool sky bounce — fills the shade side
  const keyEdge = (x, y, w, h, a) => { ctx.globalAlpha = a == null ? 0.22 : a; px(x, y, w, h, KEY); ctx.globalAlpha = 1; };
  const rimEdge = (x, y, w, h, a) => { ctx.globalAlpha = a == null ? 0.24 : a; px(x, y, w, h, SKY); ctx.globalAlpha = 1; };

  /* ============ ORIENTATION ============
     Props were authored facing ONE way — south — because that is what the v3/v4 law bakes in: a
     foreshortened TOP face over a south-facing FRONT face, under ONE fixed light (warm KEY high and
     west, cool SKY rim east). So a facing is NOT a canvas transform in the general case: turning a
     chair 90° would swing its backrest (drawn at y-4, real vertical ELEVATION) out sideways and
     rotate the light with it. Turned views are AUTHORED, one fn per facing (see AUTHORED TURNED
     VIEWS near viewAt).

     Two things ARE derived, and only these:
       DECAL TURN — a prop with no elevation at all (rug, cable run, hazard pad) IS its own top face,
                    so turning its footprint is the correct picture. Exact 90° integer affines keep
                    it pixel-exact.
       MIRROR     — a horizontal flip never changes which way a prop FACES; it swaps handedness,
                    which is what fixes "the lamp is on the wrong side", and it is how a WEST view is
                    derived from an authored EAST one. Geometry mirrors for free; the LIGHT does not,
                    so px() re-maps directional tones through LSWAP.

     LSWAP holds only tones whose meaning is genuinely east/west: each ramp's lit (west) <-> dk
     (east) column, and the warm west KEY <-> the cool east SKY. `sheen` (a NORTH back-edge catch),
     `ao` (downward), `top` and `face` are axis-neutral under a horizontal flip and stay put.
     KNOWN LIMIT: a facet painted as U.shade(r.face, +k) rather than r.lit is a runtime colour with
     no table entry, so it keeps its original hand — the dominant read (silhouette, top face, front
     face, emissives) is unaffected. Props drawing through raw ctx path ops set fillStyle directly,
     which px() never sees; those are excluded from mirroring (NO_MIRROR) until authored. */

    /* v6 LOUNGE AQUARIUM (2x1) — the angle, made sane.
       v4 was a pure FRONT ELEVATION: no top plane anywhere, the picture you get crouching in front
       of a tank. v5 over-corrected into an almost pure PLAN — ten rows of surface over a three-row
       sliver of glass — and Andrew's read was that it looked weird and made no sense. He is right:
       ⛔⛔⛔ A PLAN VIEW OF A TANK IS A PUDDLE. A glass box at this station's 3/4 camera shows BOTH
       of its faces, and the tank's whole subject lives in the TALLER one:
         · a FORESHORTENED SURFACE PLANE across the top — that is the 3/4, and it is exactly what v4
           had none of: you look DOWN onto the water and onto the hood;
         · the WATER COLUMN through the near glass beneath it — gravel on the floor, plants rooted in
           it, a castle standing on it, fish in SIDE view. That is the picture anyone recognises as
           an aquarium, and it is honest here because the near wall is glass.
       ⛔ THE TWO FACES ARE ONE BODY OF WATER. No steel rail between them; one authored blue ramp
          runs from the far edge of the surface down to the gravel, and the WATERLINE is the only
          marker — a real feature of a tank rather than a seam across the middle of the prop.
       ⛔ AUTHOR THE BLUES, never U.shade() a mid tone upward: shade() desaturates as it lightens, so
          the lit top of the tank comes out grey and reads as a tank missing its water.
       ⛔ THE HOOD IS ONE ROW. Stacked hardware over the glass reads as a half-empty tank.
       ⛔ GRAVEL BELONGS AT THE BOTTOM — in plan there is no bottom to put it at, which is another
          reason the column has to be the face that carries the content. */

    //   1. The rail roll was EIGHT px deep on a 48px table, so felt — the one thing that says "card
    //      table" — survived only as a slot. The roll is now a 4px PERPENDICULAR offset off a true
    //      RACETRACK capsule (semicircular ends, straight sides), which is the plan shape of a real
    //      poker table, and felt owns the top surface again.
    //   2. The pedestal was drawn with U.shade(rail, +0.46). Lightening a NEAR-BLACK desaturates it
    //      toward grey, so the base rendered as brushed steel under a black oval. Dark materials need
    //      AUTHORED lit tones (LEA_MID/LEA_LIT below) — never a large positive shade().

    //      landed inside the middle 20px and fused into one pale block. There are now exactly TWO bright
    //      clusters (board, pot); the seats are gone and everything else is held under the felt's value.
    //   4. There was no front face at all, so the oval floated. A short APRON now carries the table's
    //      edge thickness down to the pedestal, per the top-bias oblique law.
    // NEW: the betting line. A 1px cream racetrack ring printed on the felt is the cheapest unmistakable

    // community cards INSIDE the line and the rail outside it, which is where they actually belong.

       not a camera, it is a GENERATIVE PRINTER: a preview picture, CMY ink channels, a lens, and a
       slot the finished print comes out of) and so is its 30px height, which Andrew signed off. What
       was wrong is the same thing the bookshelf, the fish tank and the rack were rebuilt for:
       ⛔ IT WAS A FRONT ELEVATION. The machine had no top at all — every horizontal on it was a 1px
          line, which is the picture you get standing in front of a printer, not looking down at one.
       Two changes, no new parts:
       ⛔ THE MACHINE HAS A TOP DECK. Five rows of surface we look down onto, keyed down the WEST rail
          (a receding plane takes the key on its west rail; on the far edge it reads as a board
          STANDING against the wall), with the OUTPUT TRAY recessed into it and a finished sheet
          lying in the tray while it works. A printer's top IS a tray — this costs nothing invented.
       ⛔ THE PREVIEW PANEL IS RAKED, NOT FLAT-ON. It is a trapezoid — narrower at its far edge, wider
          at its near one — with a lit top bezel and a dark chin. That taper is the whole cue: a
          rectangle facing the camera is an elevation, a trapezoid is a plane tilted toward you. The
          picture inside is unchanged and still the hero.
       ⛔ THE PREVIEW SCREEN MUST SHOW A PICTURE, not a UI. Sky bands, a moon disc, two mountain
          silhouettes, a water line — five big shapes. Anything finer is mud at this size and, worse,
          reads as text, which is the one thing this prop must not look like it makes.
       ⛔ CMY INK CHANNELS ARE THE TELL. Nothing else in the catalog carries cyan+magenta+yellow side
          by side. ⛔ THE LENS reuses the strongbox's concentric-ring "aperture" language.

       ⛔ MATERIAL. MAT.steel instead of RAMP.steel — this is the prop a player looks at most, and it was
          the flattest of the three for the same reason: the old ramp's brightest stop is luma 110.
       ⛔ THE ARMS NEED FEET. A post that meets the pad with no flange floats; a 5px base plate with its
          own AO is what bolts it down, and it costs two rows.
       ⛔ THE PLATE IS A BEZEL. Corner bolts and a recessed screen well, so the name reads as displayed
          rather than painted on.
       ⛔ NAMEPLATE LIT = BOUND, DIM BARS = UNASSIGNED. That is the honesty contract of this prop and it
          is untouched: f.dockName is resolved LIVE by the caller from bodies/roster and never stored on

          front and the step up to the back — are the whole silhouette; the shading inside changes
          nothing until they are there.
       ⛔ THE ARMS STOP AT THE BACK. Run them the full width and they paint over the back's crown,

         PANEL with a ball-top stick and four buttons -> lower cabinet with coin slot and vent -> plinth
       ⛔ IT STANDS INSIDE ITS OWN FOOTPRINT. v56 hung 12px above the 1x2 tile and measured 36px tall,
          while its own sibling F.arcade2 — same footprint, same category, and usually placed right
          beside it — measures 27px. Nine pixels taller than the identical machine next to it is not a
          style, it is a bug you can see across the room. Every band below is anchored to
          `T = base - 26`, exactly the way arcade2 is, so the whole cabinet lives in its two tiles.
          ⛔ DO NOT re-express these offsets against `y`: `y` moves with the footprint but `T` is
             pinned to the FLOOR, which is what keeps the two cabinets shoulder to shoulder.
       ⛔ THE SIDE STRIPS ARE THE THING I MISSED. Two magenta bars running the full height of the
          screen bay are what make the cabinet glow from within instead of just carrying a lit sign.
          They also frame the screen, which is why it reads as a cabinet and not a monitor.

          contrast is what makes the joystick and buttons legible at 12px wide.

  /* v5 RUG (4x3) — the station's biggest FLOOR DECAL. Zero rise, ever.
     The whole point of this prop is that it is IN the ground plane: no oblique body, no front face, no
     contact shadow. It's the largest walked-over surface in the game, so any 3D read here would make
     every agent that crosses it look like it is clipping through furniture.

     v4 was slate-on-slate — the same value and hue as the deck it lies on, so at station zoom it read as
     a patch of dirty floor rather than as textile. v5 fixes that with VALUE and MATERIAL, not with
     pattern: a warm oxblood wool against a cold deck, and the rug's read carried by pile and wear.

     Two rejected rounds are the reason it looks like this. The first (persian / brass / kilim) had bone
     highlights, saturated ochre and a hard bordered frame — decorative clip-art in a room whose entire
     palette is muted and matte, and it was rejected on sight. So v5 holds ONE narrow value band: nothing
     lighter than ~+8% or darker than ~-14% of its own base, no white, no second hue, no border teeth and
     no fringe ticks. The medallion is an OUTLINE at +8%, half-erased by the traffic path over it — a rug

     its own base), no white and no second hue — and changes everything that identifies it:

     - MATERIAL: a FLATWEAVE, not a pile. So the weave runs down the WARP (vertical ribs every 3px) where
       the 4x3 runs across the weft, and the surface carries slubs — 2px thread catches — instead of the
       4x3's 1-in-12 fleck. Two rugs beside each other must not share a grain.
     - MOTIF: a BANDED kilim (two chevron end-bands + a hooked centre diamond) where the 4x3 is one open
       field around a single lozenge medallion. A 36px square has no room for an open field.
     - HUE: tobacco ochre against the 4x3's oxblood. ⛔ The chroma dial caps EVERY warm hue at the same
       0.52 saturation (chromaOf, top of file), so authored saturation is not a lever between two warm
       props — HUE and VALUE are the only two that separate them, and this one is a stop lighter.

  /* LARGE RUG (5x5) — the biggest floor decal in the catalog, 60x60px, and the only prop an agent can be

     white / no second hue). What is its own:

     - MOTIF: CONCENTRIC FRAMES with corner brackets and an eight-point star, not a single medallion. At
       this size an open field is 3600px of flat wool, so the structure has to be the borders; the star is
       a lozenge outline crossed by a square outline, which is what a kilim star actually is.
     - EDGE: BOUND, not frayed. A rug this big is selvedged — a rolled 1px inner edge all the way round —
       where the small mat frays. No fringe anywhere on it.
     - GRAIN: pile fleck on a 4px stride against the 4x3's 3px, so no two rugs share a weave.
     - HUE: plum/aubergine (~336°, still inside chromaOf's warm band, so it grades like wool and not like
       cool machinery) — a stop DARKER than the oxblood 4x3, which is how a big rug stays ground.
     Two traffic paths cross it, not one: a rug you can walk around is a rug you walk over both ways. */

  /* ============ TABLES (2026-07-26) ============
     The catalog had big hero surfaces (holotable, wartable, bar, bench) and nothing in between, so
     every small object — a plasma globe, a lava lamp, a terrarium — had to be parked on the deck,
     where it reads as litter. These three exist to be SAT ON: each carries `surface: true`, and a
     prop whose catalog row says `mount: 'surface'` may be placed on their tiles.

     THE ONE RULE THAT MAKES STACKING WORK: every table presents its top plane at the SAME height,
     SURFACE_RISE px above the floor line, so a mounted prop is drawn by shifting it up one constant
     and lands convincingly on ANY table. If you author a new table, its top face must straddle that
     plane — otherwise objects float above it or sink into it. There is no per-table offset and there
     should never be one: the moment tables disagree on height, every mounted prop needs a lookup. */
  /* THE THREE TABLES ARE DRAWN TOP-DOWN. v6 drew all three EDGE-ON — you saw the front lip of the
     top as a 3-4px band with legs under it, which is the view you get standing at eye level beside a
     table. This station is TOP-BIAS OBLIQUE: the camera looks DOWN, so a table's whole subject is its
     TOP SURFACE, drawn as a foreshortened plane, with only a short thickness and legs beneath it.
     Andrew rejected all three on exactly this ("set up as if you're looking at it at eye level, which
     you're not") and approved the crate and the bar, both of which lead with a big top plane — as do
     desk and couch. So this is v3's locked projection law, which v6 had quietly broken.

     THE LAYOUT IS FORCED, so all three share it. SURFACE_RISE pins 'top' (= y+3 at h:1) to the plane a
     mounted prop is seated on, and that plane has to be the top surface's NEAR EDGE — put it anywhere
     else and everything standing on a table floats or sinks. Working back from that:
         top-8 .. top      the top surface, 9 rows, foreshortened
         top+1 .. top+2    the top's own THICKNESS — the slab edge
         top+3 .. top+8    the legs, with BARE DECK between them
     A first attempt at this projection let the top plane run down to y+6 and drew the legs behind it,
     which left 3px leg stubs and all three tables read as solid BOXES. A table is a plane held UP;
     if you cannot see daylight under it, it is a crate. */

  /* ---- THE GLASS LOUNGE TABLE (2026-08-17, Andrew: "one more low table thats more of the lounge
     style, like a glass lounge table"). The catalog's other glass table — LOUNGE TABLE, 2x1 — is an
     office coffee table: steel legs, datapads on the shelf, a table you put a laptop on. This one is
     the living-room piece: three tiles wide, a BRASS frame instead of steel, and a shelf carrying
     magazines and a bowl rather than hardware.
     ⛔ WHAT MAKES IT LOUNGE IS THE AIR. The wooden LOW TABLE next to it reads low by MASS — a thick
        slab that eats the daylight. Glass cannot do that: a thin pane over a solid base is a display
        cabinet. It reads low by being SEEN THROUGH — the shelf and its clutter sit inside the pane's
        own rows, the frame under it is four thin posts and nothing else, and the deck runs clean
        between them.
     ⛔ GLASS IS THE WEDGE, NOT THE ALPHA (earned on the turned lounge table): over a near-black deck
        a translucent tint is just a dark panel. The diagonal specular sweep IS the glass. */

       POD CHAIR   — ROUND. A deep moulded bucket on a swivel pedestal, opening toward whatever it
                     faces. Lounge furniture: soft, warm-cushioned, no hard edge on it anywhere.
     ⛔ TWO EARLIER ATTEMPTS AT A SECOND SEAT WERE CUT ON SIGHT — a hooped brass cafe chair (fragile
        at this size and furniture from the wrong planet) and a harnessed crash seat. This station's
        seating is MOULDED: a rigid shell with something soft set into it. When one design in a pair

     deliberately place. `facings()` reads the F table directly, so deleting the function IS the

  /* ---- THE GUITAR (2026-08-17) — the last casual prop, and ELECTRIC on Andrew's call. Everything
     else built today is FURNITURE: things a room is arranged around. This is the opposite kind of

     down, which is what makes a lounge read as lived in rather than furnished. The station already
     had a speaker, a jukebox and a DJ booth; nobody owned an instrument.
     ⛔ AN ELECTRIC IS ITS HORNS, AN ACOUSTIC IS ITS WAIST. The acoustic draft here read as a PADLOCK
        ON A STICK until the body was painted row by row for the pinch; the electric abandons that
        shape entirely for a SOLID body with two cutaway horns reaching up either side of the neck.
        Those two notches are the silhouette, and they are also what tells the two apart at a glance,
        so the hardware inside (pickguard, pickups, bridge, knobs) is detail ON the shape, never a
        break in it.
     ⛔ AND IT IS PLUGGED IN. A jack lead sagging from the body to the deck is one curve of 1px, and
        it does more to say ELECTRIC than any amount of chrome — a limp line is the one thing a
        pixel-art prop can own that a rigid silhouette cannot. */

       SURVIVE PIXELS: two side spikes, a notch cut up the middle of the lower half, and a sharp
       headstock give the eye four unmistakable angles at any size, and no shading is doing the work.

       ⛔ A DISH READS BY ITS TILT. Drawn as an upright ellipse it is a plate, or worse a grey blob —
          v29 proved that even with correct concave shading. What says "dish" is an aperture aimed
          somewhere: a circle foreshortened along a TILTED axis, so you see into the bowl.
       ⛔ RIBS ARE NOISE AT THIS SIZE. v29's six radials read as cracks. The bowl is described by its
          shading gradient and its rim, nothing else.
       ⛔ The bowl is CONCAVE, so its lighting inverts: the interior wall nearest the light sits in
          shadow and the FAR wall catches it. The bright arc lives on the rim, on the lit side only.
       The bowl is rasterised per pixel through a rotated ellipse test, so every edge lands on the
       world grid — canvas arcs antialias into mud at 24px. */

          slightly open, and the glow escaping from BEHIND it — light leaking out of a dark object reads
          hotter than any amount of bright fill.
       ⛔ THE GREEN IS KEPT. That acid glow is the treasury identity across the catalog; only the vessel
          around it changed. It is banded across the ramp now (deep core -> mid throat -> pale lick) so
          it models as fire rather than as a flat panel.
       ⛔ ROUTE IN, ROUTE OUT. A token hopper on the crown and a coin chute at the base say what the

          carrying one tall glowing channel. That asymmetry is the entire silhouette — every version
          I made was symmetrical and therefore generic.
       ⛔ A CHAMFERED CAP WIDER THAN THE BODY, sitting proud with its own lit top plane and one
          indicator slot. It reads as a separate casting dropped on top, not as the body's first row.
       ⛔ A VENTED PLINTH with a dot grid, and FEET the carcass stands on. Both are what stop it
          floating; the reference has them and my versions ended at a flat bottom edge.
       ⛔ The glowing channel is ONE tall unbroken run with a hot core and a dark housing — not a
          stack of little LEDs. It is the only emissive on the prop and it does all the work. */

  /* ============ TABLETOP SET (2026-07-29) ============
     Small objects that live ON a table (`stack: true`), authored after the mount axis gained its third
     state. Every one of these is drawn in the ordinary footprint frame with its contact on the footprint
     BOTTOM — draw() lifts the whole origin by SURFACE_RISE when a table is under it, so none of them
     bakes a mount height and all of them are equally correct standing on bare deck.

     THE SCALE RULE THAT MAKES THEM READ: a tile is 12px and an agent is ~35px, so a mug that fills its
     tile is a mug the size of a torso. These are authored 5-9px wide, centred, sitting in the LOWER
     half of the tile — the empty margin is what says "small object", and it is also the gap that lets
     several of them sit along one LONG TABLE without merging into a single mass. They keep the v3
     projection (visible top surface, short front face) and the v4 material kit; identity is in the

    /* v64 BOOKSHELF (2x1) — PROJECTION FIXED (2026-08-17). v63's art was good and is kept almost
       tone for tone; what was wrong is that it was drawn as a FRONT ELEVATION — the picture you get
       standing at eye level in front of a bookcase. This station is top-down 3/4, and the tell is
       always the same: at eye level every horizontal is a 1px LINE, from above every horizontal is
       a PLANE. v63 had a 2px "crown", 1px shelf boards and books with 1px tops. So:
       ⛔ THE CASE TOP IS A PLANE, NOT A CROWN LINE. 5 rows of timber we look down onto, keyed down
          its WEST rail end to end (a receding surface takes the key on its west rail — put it on the
          far edge and the board reads as a plank STANDING against the wall). Same law the turned
          tables were rebuilt under.
       ⛔ EVERY SHELF BOARD SHOWS ITS TOP. 2 rows of lit board with the books' feet on its FAR edge,
          so the empty front strip of each board is visible in front of the row. That strip is what
          says "we are above this", and it costs two rows.
       ⛔ EVERY BOOK GETS A TOP CAP. A spine is now a short face under a 1px block of page/board seen
          from above — head-edge cream on the leaning ones, cover colour on the upright ones.
       ⛔ THINGS LYING FLAT ARE PLANES TOO. The stack shows its top COVER as a 3-row surface with the
          page edges stepping down in front of it; the plant is a splayed crown around a pot RIM.
       Kept from v63: warm back panel that falls off toward the floor, lit west / shaded east inner
       returns, 2px spines with dark voids between groups, gilt on two books a shelf only, no lamp. */

    /* (2) THE ARMS. This prop has now failed in both directions and the useful part is WHY:
       ⛔ v5 was 1.6x oversize (a 30px rifle against a 35px body — "too big for the agents").
       ⛔ v6 was measured EXACTLY right at 18px and Andrew could no longer tell what he was looking
          at. Both are true: a 0.9m rifle at the station's ~20px/metre IS 18px, and 18px cannot hold
          the silhouette that identifies a rifle. That is the RESOLUTION CEILING this catalog keeps
          hitting, not an art failure.
       So the answer is not a third size, it is FEWER THINGS WITH MORE ROOM: one rifle and one blade
       instead of two rifles and a blade, the rifle drawn at 22px (~1.1m — a hero scale a hair over
       true, the way a game prop is allowed to be) with every part given a pixel it can be read by,
       and the parts separated by DARK so the eye can find each one against the well.
       ⛔ THE RULE THAT COMES OUT OF THIS: when a prop cannot be both true-scale and legible, cut the
          COUNT, not the size. Two objects at 22px read; three at 18px are a texture. */

     Andrew's brief: the station is hard to make look good because there are too FEW props, too many
     face the same way, and almost none carry colour. These are the answer to the third and the
     hardest: each is a FLOOR-SIZED object (never a tabletop trinket) built around ONE saturated
     identity — cyan glass, racing red, plasma violet, soda orange — so a room furnished from this
     shelf stops reading as a grey machine hall.
     ⛔ COLOUR IS LOCAL, LIGHT IS NOT. A prop may own any hue it likes; it is still lit by the
        station's warm west KEY and cool east SKY, and its contour is still a dark tint of its OWN
        hue. Saturated art under the shipped lightmap is the whole trick — a prop that lights itself
        differently from the room reads as a sticker.
     ⛔ ONE SILHOUETTE, THEN FILLS. Paint the whole outline first, then interiors over it. Outlining
        each panel separately is what turned an earlier batch into cabinets. */

  /* ⛔⛔⛔ THE CLAW-MACHINE RECIPE (2026-08-17, the only one of the first four Andrew kept).
     Four props were shown; three were rejected and the CLAW MACHINE was kept, so what it does is
     now the pattern for this shelf, and the three failures say why:
       1. STACKED BANDS, not one shape. Lit sign → window → contents → control band → plinth. The
          plasma column was a single tall shape (a lamp, not an object) and the soda fountain was a
          flat front (a beige box).
       2. A WINDOW WITH CONTENTS IN IT. The prizes are what make a claw machine; the read is always
          what is INSIDE, never the casing. Every prop below has something visible behind glass.
       3. ONE SATURATED BODY HUE + small saturated hardware. Not a grey box with a colour patch.
       4. UPRIGHT AND FLOOR-SIZED (1x2 minimum). The racing seat failed partly on size — one tile
          cannot carry an identity that has to compete with a 5-tile couch across the room. */

  /* CATALOG is split into two TIERS for the builder palette (shown as ⚙ SYSTEMS / ✦ DECOR):
       functional — SYSTEMS: props that DO something (place · assign · wire into real workflows)
       cosmetic   — DECOR: looks only (decoration, atmosphere, leisure)
     `tier` + `cat` drive the palette grouping; `seat:true` marks an agent-assignable workstation;
     `desc` is the hover-card blurb. None of this is read by the routing/capability backend (it keys on prop.t).

     THE MOUNT AXIS (three states — worldmodel.js checkProp enforces them):
       surface: true    this prop IS a table; other props may stand on it.
       mount:'surface'  this prop REQUIRES a table (it has no business on bare deck).
       stack: true      this prop MAY stand on a table, and is equally at home on the deck.
     stack was added 2026-07-29 because only the two mount:'surface' props could ever be placed on a
     table — a mug, a plant or a stack of printouts hit OVERLAP — so tables read as unusable. What
     earns the flag is what the ART DRAWS, never the name: an object whose contact is its own base
     (mug, pot, papers, tote, speaker cab) stacks; anything that draws legs, a stand or a deckPlate
     is floor furniture and does not (arc_microfiche is a reader DESK, comms_inbox is bolted down,
     tank/monstera are explicitly floor pieces). Every prop function anchors to its footprint bottom,
     so a stacked prop needs no art change — draw() lifts the whole origin by SURFACE_RISE. */

     A prop that is not a floor decal turns ONLY where a view was drawn for that facing. Views live
     in the same F table under a `:` suffix, which no catalog id can collide with:

       F['chair']       r=0  SOUTH — faces the room. Every prop has this one.
       F['chair:w']     r=1  WEST  — turned left  (its front points to the left of the screen)
       F['chair:n']     r=2  NORTH — a genuine back view
       F['chair:e']     r=3  EAST  — turned right

     A WEST view is derived from the authored EAST one by mirroring unless drawn by hand: for a true
     side view that is exactly right — a chair facing left really is a chair facing right, reflected
     — and px()'s LSWAP re-lights it so the key stays west. Props the mirror cannot reach (raw path
     ops, lettering) must have both sides drawn, or they stay south-only.

     r=2 (a BACK view) is rarely worth authoring: it is a picture nobody deliberately places — you
     do not turn a cabinet to face away from the room. It is authored where the object genuinely
     reads from behind (a chair pushed under a desk, a seat with a body in it).

     facings() reads the F table directly, so this cannot drift: adding F['bench:e'] gives the bench
     that facing and the R key picks it up with no list to update. */
