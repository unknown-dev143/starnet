/* SPACESTATION — intentoffer.js : the INTENT OFFER matcher.

   The Recruitment Bay and the recipe library hold 38 preconfigured classes and 50 ready-made jobs, and
   both live two clicks deep inside a bottom-bar popover. A Commander who never opens those doors never
   learns they exist. This module closes that gap from the other side: when what they just TYPED is
   plainly the job of a class or a recipe, the station says so, once, in COMMS — where they already are.

   The whole design problem is PRECISION. A discovery card that fires on a vague match is noise, and
   noise in the COMMS beat slot is worse than the undiscovered feature. So the match must be earned:

     • DISTINCTIVE TERMS ONLY. Every candidate's text is scored with inverse document frequency across
       the live catalog, so a word that appears in one class ("lease", "refund", "overnight", "resume")
       carries weight and a word that appears in thirty ("write", "help", "find") carries almost none.
       This self-maintains: adding a class that also says "contract" automatically de-weights the term
       for everyone, instead of drifting away from a hand-written keyword list.
     • A CLEAR WINNER. The top candidate must beat the runner-up by a real margin. Two plausible matches
       means the station does not actually know, and it stays silent rather than guessing.
     • A REAL SIGNAL. At least one matched term must clear the distinctiveness floor on its own — a pile
       of weak overlaps never adds up to an offer.

   Silence is the default and the honest answer. Everything here is pure (no DOM, no clock, no storage)
   so the thresholds are pinned by test/intent-offer.test.js against real phrasings.
