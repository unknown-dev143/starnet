/* SPACESTATION — bottlestore.js : R5 "BOTTLE A RUN" — save what actually worked as a reusable recipe.

   The marketplace grows from real successes: when an INTERACTIVE run went well — the Commander rated the hero's
   work 👍 — and that run was NOT itself launched from a recipe, the station offers, once, to bottle the directive
   as a custom recipe. One tap opens the R2 editor pre-filled with a deterministic proposal (Recipes.mintFromRun);
   nothing auto-saves — the user confirms/edits/saves there. Mirrors the agent-skill sourceRunId "save what worked"
   seam, and the confbeats.js discipline exactly:

     • ONE POST-RUN BEAT AT A TIME — rides Chat.nudge (the shared gentle-aside / gold-inset family). A live run, the
       awakening/intake, a focused Dialogue panel, or an open rate/turn-in control DEFERS the offer (bounded retry,
       confbeats-style); nudge()'s own clearNudge() keeps it from ever stacking with a suggestion/seed/curiosity ask.
     • DECIDED CARD VANISHES — the nudge's choice row removes itself + vanishes the prompt on either pick (COMMS law).
     • DISMISS = STOP FOREVER (memory-overhaul law) — every decided run (bottled OR waved off) latches into a
       persisted per-run denylist so that run is NEVER re-offered, this session or any later one.
     • TRUTHFUL — never offers for a recipe-launched run (it already IS a recipe), a non-task / no-work run, a
       cron/unattended run, or a run with no real directive. Only a 👍 verdict triggers it (👌/👎 never do).
     • NO XP, NO EMIT — a read-only citizen: it mints nothing on trigger and never touches U.bus. Fed by a DIRECT
       call from chat.js rateWork (the 👍/👌/👎 verdict never rides the bus), like confbeats.onFeedback.

   The heavy lifting (name/param derivation) is Recipes.mintFromRun (pure, node-tested). This store is the GATE +
   the beat + the persisted denylist. Its pure halves (shouldOffer / decisions) are node-exported for the test. */
