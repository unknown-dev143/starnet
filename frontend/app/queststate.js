/* SPACESTATION — queststate.js : the PURE durable-quest-memory engine behind the quest log.

   quests.js projects the CURRENT truth (open/done) and is deliberately stateless; this engine gives that
   projection a PAST. It folds successive projections into a small durable record:
     • firstSeenAt / completedAt per quest id — when a quest entered the log and when it REALLY finished
       (the future TROPHY CASE reads completedAt, so it is recorded from day one).
     • dismissal — the Commander waved a quest off. Dismissed = STOP FOREVER (the anti-nag law, same as
       curiosity questions): it never re-renders and never re-fires, even if the underlying thing later
       completes. Only suggestion-class quests are dismissible (dossier "get to know you" asks); milestones
       are achievements — an achievement can't nag, so it can't be dismissed.
     • completion detection = a STATUS DIFF between projections: a quest last seen open that is now done
       has genuinely completed (the real thing happened), and that edge is worth exactly one celebration.
       A quest FIRST seen already done is backfilled (completedAt recorded); whether it ALSO celebrates
       turns on ONE discriminator — was the whole state fresh (seen empty) before this fold?
         · FRESH state (first ever sync): backfill SILENTLY. Resuming a save / a first boot must not fire a
           celebration storm for old history (and a brand-new quest kind that ships already-earned lands here).
         · EXISTING state: a quest that appears already-done is a completion the Commander earned WHILE AWAY
           (an open→done edge we never got to observe live) — celebrate it exactly once. The persistent notify
           record is its receipt; an away completion must never vanish unseen.

   THE LAW (inherited from xp.js): quests never mint XP. A completion pays out sound + toast + flourish
   (the store's job) — leveling stays locked to user feedback on real built work.

   PURE + node-testable (mirrors quests.js): no Date.now / Math.random — the caller injects the clock. */
