/* SPACESTATION — pitch.js : the PURE engine for THE FIRST PITCH (the agent's first proactive use-case suggestion).

   The keystone of the "agent that points you" loop. The whole station spends the awakening + intake getting to
   KNOW its Commander (the dossier); the First Pitch is the moment that knowledge flows back the other way — the
   agent stops waiting for orders and, once it has done one real task and knows enough about you, turns to you with
   ONE confident, buildable thing to make next. This is the graduation from order-taker to advisor — the single
   most differentiating beat in the app ("i think i know what we should build — want to?").

   Two hard disciplines live here, encoded so they can't rot:
     1. NO FLUFF. A pitch is only ever something the station can actually build — it must map to a real recipe or be
        achievable with the capabilities the agent actually has. buildDirective() constrains the agent to that; a
        pitch it can't deliver would shatter presence (the hype-bot failure).
     2. ONE pitch, not a menu. A confident single suggestion takes the choosing-burden off the user (the whole
        point); a menu hands the blank-canvas paralysis right back. choices() is always [build it] + a soft out.

   The pitch itself is AGENT-REASONED, not templated: buildDirective() produces the self-assigned task the agent
   runs (reading the COMMANDER block already in its system prompt), and parsePitch() reads its structured reply
   back into a beat. This engine is the deterministic skeleton around that real reasoning — the gate (when to
   pitch), the directive (what to ask for), the parse (how to read it), and the presentation (how to say it).

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring curiosity.js / dossier.js: a `Pitch` global in the browser, module.exports
   under node. NO Date.now / Math.random — the only state is a boolean "have we pitched yet" (fire-once, anti-nag,
   same discipline as the curiosity cap); timestamps/ids are not this engine's concern. The COMMS/flow half (the
   controller that runs the directive and renders the beat) lives in the browser wiring, exactly like intake.js. */
