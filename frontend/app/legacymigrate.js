/* SPACESTATION — legacymigrate.js : one-time localStorage key migration for the Skynet→StarNet rename.

   The project was renamed Skynet → StarNet. Every browser-side key the app owns moved from the
   `skynet.*` prefix to `starnet.*`. This script runs FIRST (before any store reads localStorage —
   it is the very first <script> in index.html) and copies each legacy `skynet.*` key forward to its
   `starnet.*` name when the new key is absent. The OLD keys are LEFT IN PLACE as a rollback, so a
   downgrade still finds its data and a botched migration loses nothing. Idempotent (re-running is a
   no-op once the new keys exist) and origin-scoped (localStorage is per port, so this only ever
   touches the one origin the user loads — there is no cross-tab/worktree split-brain).

   The planning core is a PURE function so it is unit-testable headless; run() just binds it to a
   real Storage. No dependencies — safe to load before everything else. */
