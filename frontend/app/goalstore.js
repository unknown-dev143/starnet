/* SPACESTATION — goalstore.js : the live wiring around the pure GOAL-TREE engine (goals.js) — GROWTH Tier 2.

   The glue that turns a flat dossier goals-belief into a confirmed, persisted PATH the Commander watches fill in:
     • THE DECOMPOSITION FLOW — when a goals-dim belief exists with no goal tree yet, it runs the pure
       Goals.buildDirective through the EXISTING reason-only model path (the same Harness.chat plumbing pitchstore
       uses: placed:[], isTask:false, internal:true), parses the reply (Goals.parseDecomposition, value-floor +
       redact + cap), and offers ONE confirm beat ("here's how I'd break this down — good?") at the LOWEST post-run
       priority (memory turn-in + study proposals win first). Confirm persists the tree; Not-now re-offers ONLY
       after the dossier's goals belief changes (never nags). The confirm panel is a focused Dialogue, like the
       First Pitch — chat.js drives the arbitration through the shared beat slot's arc participant.
     • THE QUEST PROJECTION — the active goal renders as a header + progress meter with its next OPEN milestone as
       an actionable quest (joined into QuestStore.view via Goals.project). Accepting the milestone quest routes
       through the EXISTING work-quest path (WorkQuestStore.accept), binding the real build to the milestone so
       completing the REAL work completes the milestone — never a manual tick.
     • THE CHAINING + EVIDENCE — on every clean run end it re-reads WorkQuestStore's projection; a bound milestone
       whose work quest went done folds the milestone done (Goals.foldMilestoneDone), WRITES the run-summary line
       as evidence, advances the bar, surfaces the NEXT milestone quest, bumps Study salience (fail-open), and —
       on the last milestone — completes the whole goal. The completion rides the EXISTING queststatestore
       celebration (its open→done fold sees arc-step/arc-goal edges in the shared projection).
     • DRIFT — if the Study Engine retires the source goals belief (dossier.forget), sync() detects the belief is
       gone and retires the goal tree (kept for history, hidden from the active quest log).

   Discipline mirrors studystore.js / workqueststore.js:
   - READ-ONLY citizen of U.bus — subscribes to agent.run.end, NEVER emits (the frozen shared/events.js contract
     is owned elsewhere; lint-emits stays green).
   - Self-persists its OWN localStorage key (the goal trees + the not-now re-offer fingerprints) — no save.js
     change (the established growth-store pattern). Mirrors the active goal to the sidecar (POST /api/goals) so
     server-composed cron runs can see it, exactly like DossierStore.pushToSidecar.
   - node-exportable for its test; all DECISION logic lives in the pure Goals engine, this is the edge. */
