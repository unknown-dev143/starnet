/* SPACESTATION — ctxgauge.js : the CONTEXT-WINDOW gauge model. Pure + testable
   (UMD: a `CtxGauge` global in the browser, module.exports under node).

   Turns real numbers into a render-agnostic gauge state:
     - used  = how many tokens THIS CONVERSATION occupies in the model's window.
     - limit = the model's real max context length (OpenRouter catalog
               context_length).

   `used` has two honest provenances, and the gauge keeps them distinct:
     MEASURED  — the provider's reconciled prompt_tokens for a request this
                 conversation actually made (agent.cost.tokensIn). Exact.
     PROJECTED — harness overhead measured on a REAL request (system prompt +
                 tool schemas + server-side dressing) plus a char/4 estimate of
                 the dialogue this conversation would send next. Used when the
                 conversation on screen has not run a turn yet (a new session, a
                 session resumed from disk, or turns typed since the last reply).
                 Rendered with a leading "~" and reported as projected:true so
                 no caller can mistake it for a measurement.

   No fabricated values: with no limit AND no calibration there is nothing to
   project from, so the gauge reports known:false and the renderer shows a
   "calibrating" state — never a made-up percentage. This is the truthful-
   telemetry rule applied to context: the bar only ever asserts a fill that is
   either measured, or derived from a measurement and visibly marked as derived. */

  /* CALIBRATION — what makes a projection honest instead of invented.

     A request costs far more than the visible dialogue: the system prompt, every tool schema, and the
     sidecar's own dressing (manual / capabilities / skills / memory) ride along. On this station that
     overhead measured ~13k tokens against a two-line chat, so a browser-side estimate of the dialogue
     alone understates the truth by an order of magnitude and is worse than useless.

     It is directly observable, though: a request's real prompt_tokens MINUS our own estimate of the
     messages we put in it. That is a genuine per-model constant (the same system prompt and the same
     tool schemas ride every request), which is what makes it safe to remember and reuse.

     ⛔ Only fit it when the estimate came in AT OR BELOW the measurement. A measurement smaller than
     the transcript we sent does NOT mean the model's overhead is small — it means the sidecar folded
     older turns away before sending (context.js compacts at 0.65 of the window). That is a property of
     ONE long conversation, not of the model, and baking it into a per-model figure would understate
     every other chat on that model. Learn nothing from those and keep the last good fit; the
     conversation that was compacted is covered by its own baseline instead (see projectFromBaseline).
