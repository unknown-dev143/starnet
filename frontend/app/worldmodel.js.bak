   This is the single source of truth the builder edits and that both the renderer
   (via projectGeometry → stationbake.js) and the future AgentOrg runtime read.

   PURITY CONTRACT (so it stays headless-testable and deterministic):
     - no DOM, no canvas, no `window`/`document`
     - no ambient wall-clock or RNG — ids are a per-document counter, timestamps are injected
   It only depends on the global `U` (util.js: U.clamp/U.shade/U.hash) — none of which are
   non-deterministic. See frontend/app/BUILDER.md for the full contract.

   The model stores LOGICAL geometry in signed world-tile coords (unbounded; the station can
   grow in any direction). `projectGeometry()` emits the v7 MAP-shaped object the bake consumes,
   shifted into a non-negative local frame with a margin for the hull. */

     edges of five rooms in a screenshot: "the outer walls are not customizable... for users who
     want to put their station in the forest, and want a more cabin feel").

     DECK and WALLS dress the INSIDE of a room. The hull is everything you see of it from OUTSIDE:
     the plate that surrounds the footprint, the texture over that plate, the framed rim + bolts,
     the rounded corner arcs, and — the surface that actually reads at a glance — the SKIRT, the
     tall face extruded below the station's silhouette. All five were painted from five hardcoded
     constants, so every room in every station had the identical dark riveted shell. Now the shell
     is per room, which is what makes a mixed station read as a CITY of separate buildings rather
     than one hull with seams in it.

     `suggest` is the hue a material defaults to when the room carries no explicit hullStyle. Unlike
     the wall axis — where `suggest` is only a UI convenience — this one binds in the MODEL, because
     a hull's default has to be a tone the material was drawn for: TIMBER at the station's own
     #191712 is black wood, which is nobody's cabin. `station` alone suggests null, meaning "keep

    /* ---------- prop validation + mutations ----------
       The model stays pure: it doesn't know the prop CATALOG (that lives in propsprites.js).
       The caller supplies w,h (the footprint) from the catalog; the model only validates
       GEOMETRY — every footprint tile must sit on station floor (inside a zone), the footprint
       must not overlap another prop, and the type tag must be a non-empty string.

       MOUNT RULES (2026-07-26) are the one exception, and they are injected rather than imported so
       the layering holds: setPropRules() hands the model a lookup from prop type to
       {mount, stack, surface}. With no lookup installed (plain node tests, older callers) nothing
       changes and every prop is placeable on bare deck exactly as before.

       The mount axis has THREE states, and a prop's catalog row picks one:
         mount 'surface' — REQUIRES a table. The footprint must lie wholly on ONE prop whose catalog
                           row says surface:true, and that host is exempt from the overlap check,
                           because standing on a table is the entire point.
         stack:true      — MAY use a table. Same host rule when one is found; otherwise it places on
                           bare deck like any other prop. (2026-07-29: without this state the only
                           two props in the whole catalog that could go on a table were the two that
                           were FORCED to, so every other small object — a mug, a plant, a stack of
                           printouts — was rejected with OVERLAP the moment a table was under it.
                           A required-mount flag cannot express "a plant belongs on the floor OR on
                           a table", and forcing plant/coffee onto tables would have broken the
                           agents that place their own decor on open deck.)
         neither         — deck only; a table is an obstacle like any other prop.

       A FOURTH, orthogonal axis: flat:true (a floor DECAL — rug / cable run / hazard pad). It is not a
       mount state (a decal hosts nothing; it has no top surface, it IS the deck), it is an exemption
       from the overlap test in both directions — see checkProp.

       mount:'wall' is BACK (2026-08-17, Andrew: "we need to allow mountable wall props") — but it is
       NOT what was reverted. The first version LIFTED the prop onto the tall face the bake raises
       along a room's north edge (a WALL_RISE), and that lifted look is what he rejected on sight;
       every wall-only prop went with it. This version is the CONSTRAINT ONLY: the prop must be
       placed against a north wall and it draws exactly where it always did, hanging in its own tile
       with its own standoff shadow. Nothing lifts, so there is nothing to reject twice. */

       burn an undo slot per prop and leave half-lines on a mid-stamp failure). Editing a working

       (routes + def) so a fresh stamp never introduces a warn the Commander didn't cause.
       Placement is all-or-nothing and requires CLEAR DECK for every tile: each machine passes the
       same checkProp a hand placement runs, each belt tile passes beltPlaceable, and nothing may
       stamp over an existing belt (overwriting a laid lane, or burying one under a dock, would

         orthogonal-outward neighbours are void.

         HALLWAYS GET THE ART, NOT THE BLOCK (2026-08-10). This ran for ROOMS ONLY — "corridors stay
         slim" — and that is the whole of the broken hallway corner Andrew circled: with no chamfer,
         a hallway's convex corner is a raw right angle where the tall north face (extruded up-screen
         by WALL.corUp) collides with the side band (a top surface at floor level), and nothing
         reconciles the step between them. A room never shows it because a room gets rounded. It also
         explains why the corner tracked the 08-08 wall lane exactly: the step IS corUp tall, so
         raising it 8→12 turned a nick into a block.

         But the exclusion was not arbitrary and must not simply be deleted: a chamfer tile is also
         an UNWALKABLE tile, and hallways are narrow. MIN_HALL allows 2 wide, so blocking both
         corners of a 2-wide end row severs the hallway there — and a 2x2 hallway (Andrew has one
         joining r3 to r1) would have all four corners blocked and become an impassable hole in the
         station's connectivity. Measured, not feared: with the block left in, a 2x2 hallway comes
         back with 2 of its 4 tiles walkable. Pathing would have broken silently on existing saves.

         So the two meanings of "chamfer" are separated, because they were only ever conflated:
           · `chamfers`     — ART. What the bake rounds. Rooms AND corridors.
           · `chamferBlock` — WALKABILITY. What stops being floor. Rooms only, exactly as before.
         Corridor walkability is therefore identical to before this change; only the shell, the crown
         ring and the corner's wall art move. Locked by worldmodel.test.js. */
