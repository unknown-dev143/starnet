/* SPACESTATION — autonomy.js : the PURE engine for the AUTONOMY POSTURE — the tunable "alive between sessions" dial.

   THE DIAL IS THE PRODUCT. The station can do real work while the Commander is away and feel alive — honestly — and
   the Commander tunes exactly HOW MUCH, per agent, along TWO independent axes (separating them is the whole insight:
   "be productive on your own all day" can coexist with "but ask before anything irreversible"):

     • INITIATIVE — does it start work on its own, and how far:  wait → propose → leash → free
     • REACH      — how far any single unattended action may go before it must pause for you (= the consent ceiling):
                    observe → sandbox → reach

   The awakening's cadence beat sets the OPENING posture from four concrete, picture-able choices (never an abstract
   "how autonomous do you want me to be?" — see the awakening-question-design rule); a station dial retunes it later.
   Range is honored at BOTH ends: full wait-for-me (off) and full free-range (on).

   SAFE BY DEFAULT: fresh() is fully wait-for-me with a Sandbox ceiling, and even FREE-RANGE initiative keeps Reach
   capped at 'sandbox' — running free toward goals must never silently send/publish/spend; the Commander raises Reach
   to 'reach' deliberately. That default IS the "productive all day, asks before anything irreversible" guarantee.

   This is Slice 1: the posture MODEL only (the enums, the presets, the derived read surface). The self-directed
   task-selection engine, the cron self-initiation, and the "while you were away" digest are later slices.

   PURE + node-testable, mirroring pitch.js / quests.js: an `Autonomy` global in the browser, module.exports under
   node. NO Date.now / Math.random — a posture is a deterministic function of what the Commander chose. The thin
   browser store (autonomystore.js) self-persists it and is a read-only U.bus citizen; the awakening + the dial panel
   are the only writers. */
