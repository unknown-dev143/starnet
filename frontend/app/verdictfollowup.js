/* SPACESTATION — verdictfollowup.js : the PURE engine for the VERDICT FOLLOW-UP (momentum loop, 2026-08-21).

   The rate-the-work beat used to end `◆ close` and `▼ missed` with the word "noted" — a dead question: the
   Commander told the station its work fell short and nothing changed. A miss is the highest-information
   moment the station ever gets about HOW this Commander wants work done, and it was thrown away.

   POPUP LAW (docs/NEXT.md 2026-08-21): a popup earns its pixels only when the answer CHANGES something
   observable. This follow-up asks ONE thing — "what missed?" — and every chip maps to a Commander Dossier
   dimension, so the answer becomes a belief that rides into every later agent's briefing (Dossier.composeBlock).
   Nothing is asked on `▲ nailed it` (nothing to learn), nothing is asked twice for one run, and "skip" writes
   nothing. PURE + node-testable (a `VerdictFollowup` global in the browser, module.exports under node); the
   DOM, the beat slot and the dossier write live in chat.js. */
