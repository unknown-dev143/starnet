/* SPACESTATION — resummonstore.js : P3.1 "RUN THIS AGAIN?" — the re-summon signal.

   Retention fast-follow: right after the Commander rated the hero's work 👍 on a real interactive run, the station
   offers ONCE, lightly, to run that same shape of work again — tied to the SAME agent and the run's directive. One
   tap PRE-FILLS a fresh run (selects that agent's stream + seeds the composer with the directive) and NEVER auto-runs
   it: the Commander edits and sends. It is not a new unearned suggestion surface — it rides a run the Commander just
   rated, so the work-earned floor is already satisfied.

   It is a READ-ONLY citizen modelled exactly on bottlestore.js (the R5 "bottle it?" offer):

     • ONE POST-RUN BEAT AT A TIME — rides Chat.nudge (the shared gold-inset gentle-aside family). A live run, the
       awakening/intake, a focused Dialogue panel, or an open rate/turn-in control DEFERS the offer (bounded retry,
       bottlestore-style); nudge()'s own clearNudge() keeps it from ever stacking with a suggestion/seed/curiosity ask.
       It LOSES the slot gracefully — if the moment never frees, it quietly expires (asks for nothing).
     • DECIDED CARD VANISHES — the nudge's choice row removes itself on either pick (COMMS law).
     • DISMISS = STOP FOREVER (memory-overhaul law) — every decided run (re-summoned OR waved off) latches into a
       persisted per-run denylist so that run is NEVER re-offered, this session or any later one.
     • TRUTHFUL — only a 👍 ('great') verdict triggers it (👌/👎 never do); only a real interactive TASK run that did
       work, with a real directive; never a cron/unattended run. Hero-only.
     • NO XP, NO EMIT — a read-only citizen: it mints nothing and never touches U.bus. Fed by a DIRECT call from
       chat.js rateWork (the 👍/👌/👎 verdict never rides the bus), like bottlestore/confbeats.

   The GATE + the beat + the persisted denylist live here (its pure halves are node-exported for the test); the actual
   pre-fill (select agent + seed composer) is deps injected by app.js. */
