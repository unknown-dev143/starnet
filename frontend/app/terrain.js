/* SPACESTATION — terrain.js : THE GROUND. What the station is standing ON.

   THIS IS NOT A BACKDROP, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT.

   spacebg.js draws things at a DISTANCE, in screen space, deliberately not zooming — correct for
   a starfield or a sea a long way below. Terrain is at the SAME PLANE as the station: it must pan
   AND zoom with it, or the illusion dies on the first scroll-wheel tick. The camera zooms 0.5x to
   6x (world.js MINZ/MAXZ), a 12x range, so faking that in screen space would fall apart violently.

   So the ground is drawn in WORLD space, between world.js's setTransform() and the station bake.
   At that seam the camera transform is already applied, which means panning, zooming and the
   station's own coordinate frame all come for free — no parallax maths, no toroidal wrap, no
   camera plumbing.

   THREE layers, because they fail differently:
     1. THE PATCH — soil, moss, litter. Fine texture, tiled with createPattern (ONE fillRect, not
        hundreds of drawImage). Fine texture can repeat every few hundred pixels invisibly.
     2. THE FIELD — a world-space value noise that decides how much grows WHERE. This is what the
        first forest lacked: it scattered trees at a flat 38% everywhere, so the eye read an even
        stipple with no groves, no glades and no edges. Density variation is structure, and
        structure is most of what "detailed" actually means.
     3. THE SCATTER — trees, logs, ferns, boulders. These CANNOT tile: a repeating tree is
        instantly legible as wallpaper. They are placed by hashing world cell coordinates, which
        gives an infinite non-repeating field with no stored map, drawn from pre-rendered sprites
        so a crown costs one drawImage rather than four hundred stamps every frame.

   The station stands in a CLEARING: scatter is suppressed inside the station's world rect plus a
   margin, and thickened just outside it, because a real clearing has a dense edge.

   WHY THE FIRST FOREST WAS SCRAPPED (2026-07-24, Andrew: "too blurry… just looks like an outline
   of a forest") and what is different here:
     - Crowns were 8 overlapping anti-aliased arcs. A blob with a lit rim IS an outline. Crowns are
       now built from hundreds of hard 1-3px LEAF STAMPS lit by a dome+sun term, with holes punched
       through them, so the mass has interior texture and the ground shows through it.
     - One species. There are now five silhouettes (broadleaf, conifer, birch, snag, sapling) and a
       conifer does not read as a maple from any distance.
     - No layering. Items are y-sorted and overlap, which is the only cue that says "canopy" rather
       than "stickers".
     - Flat lighting. A tiled DAPPLE pass now puts sun through the canopy onto the floor, so the
       floor has large-scale light structure instead of uniform noise. */

       station tile. A person is about 1.7m, so:

           ⛔ ONE WORLD PIXEL IS ABOUT 5cm.

       is worth keeping: **an empty texture contains no scale cue at all**, so judging one is not
       merely hard, it is impossible — every render looked fine because there was nothing in the

    /* ---- the tiling floor: duff, moss, litter, needles, grass, roots, stones ----

       ANDREW'S NOTE ON THE FIRST ONE — "it almost blends like camouflage when the ground is
       visible" — was not a metaphor. It was a diagnosis, and it was exact.

       DPM camouflage is made by ONE recipe: irregular soft-outlined blobs a few hundred px
       across, in two or three hues at near-equal VALUE, with no smaller structure inside them.
       That is what this floor was, and it was nothing else. A wetness field at lattice 3 and 7
       over a 512 tile drew blobs 170px and 73px wide — TREE-CROWN SCALE — choosing between two
       ramps whose value barely differed, and over that went a dapple pass of quantized 3-step
       blobs at 640px. The only other content was 2600 litter flakes, 420 twigs and 700 moss dots
       drawn 1-3px at 14-50% alpha: below the size and above the transparency at which an eye
       resolves a shape, so from any real viewing distance they integrate into a flat wash and
       contribute nothing at all. The entire legible content of the surface was two fields of
       soft blobs at the same scale and the same value as the trees standing on it. That IS
       camouflage — it is the definition, not a resemblance.

       THE THREE MOVES OUT, and every one of them is about FIGURE AND GROUND:

       1. MOSS STOPS BEING A SECOND GROUND. There is one material now — duff — and moss is
          STIPPLED onto it with a density that fades to zero, the same trick that stopped crowns
          merging into a mat. A filled region has an outline, and an outline at crown scale is a
          camo patch; a density gradient of individual specks has no outline anywhere, and reads
          as something growing where it can. Its field also runs four times faster, so where moss
          does gather it is smaller than every crown and can never be mistaken for one.

       2. THE FLOOR GETS OBJECTS, NOT MARKS. Every leaf, needle, twig, blade and stone below is
          OPAQUE, is sized from a POWER LAW so a handful are 9px and most are 3px, and sits on
          its own CONTACT SHADOW. That last part is the entire difference: a translucent flake is
          noise, but a 5px leaf with a darkened pixel under its down-sun edge is a thing LYING on
          the ground — and two thousand of those are a forest floor. Value structure has to come
          from objects, because value is what the eye segments on.

       3. THE FLOOR GETS LONG LINES. Surface roots run out from every trunk in a real wood, and a
          surface with no long feature in it can only ever read as texture. They are drawn as
          RELIEF — lit crest, shaded down-sun flank, contact shadow beyond — the same way the
          moon's wrinkle ridges are.

       ⛔ WHY THIS WRITES BYTES INSTEAD OF CALLING fillRect. Canvas fills are anti-aliased and
       there is no flag to stop it, so a 3px leaf drawn through the 2D API arrives as a grey
       smudge — the exact "blurry" the first forest died of. Writing into the ImageData buffer
       gives hard pixels; the modulo inside idx() makes the tile seamless for free, with no 3x3
       re-stamping to get wrong; and being able to READ a pixel back is what lets a contact
       shadow DARKEN whatever is under it instead of painting a flat patch on top of it.

  /* A landed station on a mare plain. The forest's problem was making an organic mass legible;
     the moon's is the opposite — there is exactly ONE material out here, so every scrap of
     interest has to come from FORM. Which is lucky, because form is what a crater is.

     THREE THINGS CARRY IT:
       1. THE SUN IS LOW AND THERE IS NO AIR. Shadows are long, hard and BLACK — no atmospheric
          fill light, no colour bounce, no falloff. That single fact is most of the drama, and it
          is why the shadow colour here is nearly (0,0,0) while the forest's is a dark green.
       2. CRATERS ARE HOLES, NOT DOMES, and the difference is which side is lit. In a bowl the FAR
          wall (down-sun) catches the light and the near wall is in shadow — precisely inverted
          from a boulder. Get that backwards and the whole plain inflates into bubble wrap; it is
          the classic failure of every procedural moon.
       3. SCALE HIERARCHY. Real regolith is craters inside craters inside craters, over five
          orders of magnitude. Three placement grids (basins, craters, pits) plus micro-pits baked
          into the tiling patch is enough to fake that, and it is what keeps the plain from reading
          as a texture with dots on it. */

         the OUTER slope faces the sun (bright) while the INNER slope faces away (dark); on the
         down-sun side both are exactly reversed. So the two bands are lit by the same term with

         side — at two radii 14% apart, which at any real zoom is the same circle. The sum of two
         correct half-rings was one wrong full ring, and the plain came out as pegboard.

         parallel to the sun show nothing at all. So the band's WIDTH tapers with the same term that

       size and roughly round, so there is no composition at any scale bigger than one crater. Real
       mare basalt is crossed by wrinkle ridges — long, low, sinuous swells, hundreds of px of gentle
       rise, and under a low sun they are the most legible thing out there.

       BUILT AS CHAINABLE SEGMENTS, not drawn per frame. Stamping a ridge pixel by pixel in world
       space would be twenty thousand fillRects a frame; instead each segment sprite carries its
       crest through the vertical CENTRE at both its left and right edges, so any two segments in
       any order join seamlessly and a lane of them is one continuous ridge for the cost of four
       drawImage calls. */

         The first cut gave every segment the same crest height at both edges, which chains

         Two of those across a frame read as seams, not landforms. Instead each segment declares a
         START level and an END level from {-1,0,+1}; the placer picks the level per column with a
         hash, so segment N's end always matches segment N+1's start and the lane wanders diagonally

     the station won't deliver.

     BUILT AT A REFERENCE SIZE AND SCALED DOWN, which is the same law the sky swatches learned:
     drawing straight into a 112x63 chip shows one third of one tree crown, because the features
     are sized in WORLD px and the chip is a tiny window onto the world — not a small picture of
     it. Rendering a proper 4x view and shrinking it shows the place instead of a close-up of its
     dirt.

     MEMOISED, because a sample costs a whole ground BUILD. `st = null` below forces build(id) to
     regenerate the patch, the overlay and every sprite pool before it can draw one chip — measured
     live on a seeded station at 112x63: moon 400ms, forest 150ms, and SETTINGS repainted all six
     swatches on EVERY build of the panel (open, tab swap, any rerender). The inputs are fully
     deterministic (fixed seed 0x0FE57, no camera, no clock, no theme), so the cached chip is
     bit-identical to a fresh render — this caches the REAL renderer's output, it does not stand in
     for it, and the honesty law is intact. Keyed by id+size+zoom so a differently-sized picker
     still renders its own. */
