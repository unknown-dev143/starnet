/* STARNET — glossary.js : the one place the station explains its own words to a first-minute user.

   A pure term -> one-sentence map, consumed by hint.js (data-hint="<term>" tooltips). Copy law:
   lowercase station voice, eerie-not-cute, one plain sentence a beginner can act on. Every entry
   is grounded in how the term is ACTUALLY used in the code (marketplace.js / autonomy.js / stationui.js
   / returnstore.js) — not an aspirational definition. Keys are lowercased on lookup, so
   data-hint="REFIT" and data-hint="refit" resolve the same entry.

   UMD: a `Glossary` global in the browser; module.exports under node/tests. No DOM, no deps. */

    system:       'the dock for the manual, settings, updates, restore points, history, and alerts.',
    workstream:   'the saved conversation behind a COMMS session; planned task conversations also appear as cards on the TASK BOARD.',
    orchestrator: 'the lead agent you talk to first — new agents inherit its model unless you pick another.',
    overseer:     'the station itself — it holds shared gear that any specialist can draw on.',
    refit:        'the station’s build mode — open it from the dock to place desks, furniture, and gear.',
    clearance:    'how hard the agent’s model thinks — more diamonds mean deeper (slower) reasoning.',
    lane:         'the kind of work a class is built for: CODE, RESEARCH, or general OPS.',
    dish:         'the WEB gear — with it on station, an agent can search and fetch live pages.',

    drafted:      'written up by the station for you to review — nothing is summoned until you confirm it.',
    sidecar:      'the small local program that actually runs your agents — the app talks to it in the background.',
    // the WORK vocabulary, each on ONE axis (UX confusion audit 2026-07-15: recipe=WHAT to run,
    // routine=WHEN it runs, task=WHERE live work sits, quest=progress/suggestions — never a place work lives).
    automation:   'the home of standing work — ROUTINES (any job on a schedule) and LOOPS (one objective, repeated until it’s done) share this one panel.',

    task:         'a planned piece of work created on the board or launched from a recipe or goal — it appears on the ☑ TASK BOARD and opens as a COMMS session.',
    quest:        'a suggestion or progress marker from the station — accepting one starts real work; it is never a second to-do list.',
    // Business OS (Phase 1). The per-business stop is deliberately described as SCOPED: it is not the E-STOP,
    // and copy that blurred the two would make a user think pausing one business froze the whole station.
    business:     'a venture you run on the station — it keeps its own stage and its own activity log, and setting it to PAUSED stops its work without halting the rest of the station.',
    maker:        'where an idea becomes a business — you write down what you claim to know, label HOW you know it, try to prove yourself wrong, and only then create the business. Nothing here is scored for you; you get the counts and the labels, and you decide.',
    team:         'the agents a BUSINESS has hired — each one is one of twelve roles, filled by a real class from the catalog, with its own permission set and its own memory. Hiring one does not start it: an agent runs only safe work on its own, and asks you for everything else.',
    // Business OS (Phase 4). The MANAGER is where the business is RUN rather than made or staffed. The two
    // sentences worth spelling out are the two the console refuses to blur: real money is never added to an
    // AI guess, and a metric nobody recorded reads "not recorded" rather than 0.
    manager:      'where you run a business day to day — its money, its numbers, its customers, its content, its documents and its experiments. Every figure is kept as two separate things: what is REAL (recorded) and what the AI GUESSED (estimated), never added together; and a number nobody has recorded says so instead of showing a zero.',
    skill:        'something an agent CAN do — some skills only switch on once their gear is on station. Browse them under ⇄ ABILITIES ▸ SKILL LIBRARY.',
    toolset:      'a family of tools you can switch on or off for agents (web, files, terminal…) — the switches live in the TOOLSETS section of ⇄ ABILITIES.',
    capability:   'the same tool families as TOOLSETS, read-only — what an agent is equipped with right now; each agent’s readout is the SKILLS tab of its dossier.',
    connector:    'an outside service you plug IN so agents can use it as a tool (calendar, Slack actions, databases).',
    channel:      'your way IN from a messaging app — connect Telegram/Slack/Discord and talk to your agents from your pocket.',
    autonomy:     'how far an agent may act on its own between your messages — you set the ceiling.',
    initiative:   'whether an agent starts work on its own — the same four rungs everywhere: WAIT, SUGGEST, BUILD, FREE.',
    reach:        'the farthest a single unattended action may go — the same three rungs everywhere: OBSERVE (read only), SANDBOX (write locally), SEND & PUBLISH (contact the outside).',
    pace:         'how many small unattended jobs an agent may do per day at most.',
    xp:           'experience an agent earns from work you rate well — it levels up as it proves itself.',
    workspace:    'the folder on your machine where an agent’s files land (workspaces/<agent>/).',
    desk:         'an agent’s own workstation — it needs one placed in REFIT before it can take floor work.',
    recruit:      'summon a new agent class onto your crew, or re-spec the agent you already have.',
    slag:         'a post-mortem of a run that ended without producing anything — its cause, and the fix.',
    kudos:        'the good ratings you give an agent’s work — they raise its satisfaction and earn it XP.',
    leash:        'the cap on how many jobs an agent may do on its own before it stops and waits for you.',
    beat:         'one small unattended job the station does while you’re away — the daily limit caps how many.',
    'e-stop':     'the emergency stop — it halts every unattended job at once until you re-arm autonomy.',
    'restore point': 'a saved snapshot of an agent’s workspace you can roll it back to.',
