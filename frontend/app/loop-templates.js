/* SPACESTATION — loop-templates.js : the LOOP SHAPES a beginner picks instead of writing a loop from scratch.

   THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. A blank "what should it keep doing?" box is the reason loops are confusing: it
   asks someone who has never run one to invent the cycle, the stopping condition, and the guard rails all at
   once. A template supplies all three and leaves two blanks. Picking BUILD · TEST · VERIFY and typing a goal
   should produce a loop that is already shaped correctly.

   Deliberately modelled on recipes.js (`params[]` + token-filled template + a frozen catalog), because that
   pattern is proven here and the marketplace already knows how to render it. The difference is what a loop
   template additionally carries: the CYCLE (`shape`), what ENDS it (`exitOn`), and how strong that ending
   actually is (`rigor`).

   RIGOR IS NOT DECORATION. Only a loop whose exit condition is a real process exit code has a HARD guarantee:
   the station runs the project's own check and reads the code. Everything else — "keep sweeping until you stop
   finding things", "research until nothing new turns up" — rests on the model honestly reporting an empty
   digest each pass, which is a convention, not a proof. Both are useful; presenting them as equally rigorous
   would be a truthful-telemetry violation, so `rigor` rides on the record and the UI must show it.

   PURE: no DOM, no fetch, no clock. Headless-testable (test/loop-templates.test.js).

     rigorNote(t)                    -> string             // the honest one-liner about how this loop ends

  /* THE DIGEST RULE — lifted from the QA crew's own loop directives (loops/README.md rule 4), because it is
     already proven to work on this project's real 24/7 loops:

       "One digest line minimum per tick, even if 'no findings' — silence is indistinguishable from a dead session."

     This is the convergence mechanism for every SOFT loop, and it is deliberately not a request to concede.
     Asking a model to declare itself finished fails, because models are trained to be helpful and will invent
     work rather than admit there is none. Asking it to FILE A REPORT — including an empty one — is something
     models do reliably. The loop then counts empty reports; three in a row and it parks itself. */
